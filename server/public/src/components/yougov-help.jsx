          The Political Ad Collector is a tool you add to your Web browser. It
          copies the ads you see on Facebook, so anyone, on any part of the
          political spectrum, can see the political ads in our public database.
          The ads, along with the unique YouGov ID associated with your survey
          answers and demographic info, will also be shared with academic
          researchers and certain journalists; your ID, answers and demographic
          info will NOT be shared publicly.
