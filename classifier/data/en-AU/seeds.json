system from Circular Quay to Randwick and Kingsford operating as 30 coupled sets, 67 metres in length. \u201cSydney is the first city in the world to receive the Citadis X05 vehicle and I am pleased to note they are fully accessible with low-floors, double doors, dedicated areas for wheelchairs and prams and low-level on-board passenger intercoms,\u201d Mr Constance said. \u201cThese trams use four times less energy than an average bus and 10 times less energy than a car. \u201cThe next step will be to begin testing the vehicles along part of the track later in the year, ahead of services starting operation in 2019.\u201dEach light rail vehicle set can carry up to 450 people, equivalent of up to nine standard buses, meaning less congestion on Sydney\u2019s roads and more reliable travel times.Currently, more than 50 cities worldwide use global rail transport supplier Alstom\u2019s Citadis light rail vehicles, with the X05 model to be a world first in Sydney.The CBD and South East Light Rail will provide reliable, high frequency \u2018turn up and go\u2019 transport services from Circular Quay and the CBD, to Randwick and Kingsford via Surry Hills, Moore Park and Kensington

To take an idea, to back yourself and to have a go.There are no guarantees. No clauses. No caveats. It\u2019s you and your own hard work.I remember \u2014 15 years ago that was me. I started my own small business doing much the same. I had three kids and my family needed food on the table. So I got to work.And every single day millions of you do the same.That\u2019s why the Liberals and Nationals want to make it easier for small businesses, regardless of their business structure.We know you are the risk-takers our nation needs to survive and grow. You build our houses, feed and clothe us, and keep Australia moving. We know you are the ones who give our kids the start they deserve and you invest in our communities. And we know you work damn hard.So recently, we reduced unincorporated small business taxes by 8 per cent and expanded the definition of a small unincorporated business from $2 million turnover to $5 million.We also reduced the small business tax rate for companies to 27.5 per cent and expanded the small business definition from a $2 million to $10 million turnover.That\u2019s the lowest company tax rate since WWII.This made thousands more businesses eligible for the $20,000 instant asset write-off. So you can buy the new equipment \u2014 maybe new tools, a computer or a run-a-round ute \u2014 and write it off immediately, helping your business grow.Because when you\u2019re going well, so too is our country. And we want to help you do well.But recently the politics of envy has taken over and Labor has you in its sights. In spruiking the need for new taxes and abolishing trusts, your turnover is seen as a river of gold from which Labor can fund its tax-and-spend ideology, hurting business and our economy.Bill Shorten\u2019s new tax grab on trusts will hit 200,000 small businesses. It\u2019s policy on the run which targets stock and station agents but exempts the farmers who drive their businesses.It forgets stock and station agents go through seasonal ups and downs too, as does every small business along a country town\u2019s main street.It\u2019s another Labor thought bubble.Labor doesn\u2019t get regional Australia and it doesn\u2019t get small business.It calls you \u201cmillionaires\u201d, jealous of your success and the growth you create.Labor doesn\u2019t get that you grow our economy and it doesn\u2019t get that tax cuts actually help jobs and wages grow. Which is not a surprise, given very few of them \u2014 around half a dozen of almost a hundred Labor MPs \u2014 have actually run a business.That\u2019s why, when tax grabs are all the go, Labor looks at you.The Federal government has dropped the small business tax rate for companies to 27.5 per cent. Picture: Adam Yip / Manly DailyWe introduced that law to cut your taxes and Labor voted against it. We increased the number of small businesses \u2014 including sole traders \u2014 who could use the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Labor wants to roll that back.Our tax cut plan means even more small businesses can hire more Australians, grow our economy and workers\u2019 wages, while Bill Shorten wants to put his hand in your till.Around Australia I have met hundreds of small business owners who are using our tax cuts to hire more people, pursue new ideas and help our economy grow.I\u2019ve seen how you use the instant asset write-off.

BILL SHORTEN MPLEADER OF THE OPPOSITIONREMARKS TO LABOR CAUCUS MEETINGPARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA MONDAY, 7 AUGUST 2017  Welcome back, everybody and congratulations on the winter break that you've had, putting forward social and economic programs for the betterment of this country, working very hard. Some of those ideas that we've been pushing forward on: -       New investment in infrastructure, jobs in tourism in northern Australia. -       Proposing a way forward on constitutional recognition for our First Australians and an Australian head of state. -       And I think very importantly, we've been proposing a fairer tax system for all Australians, making sure that all Australians get the same deal.  But when I think about the winter break that we have had, I then think briefly about the six weeks of the Liberal-National Coalition doing everything they can to delay marriage equality in this country. I did wonder though, if the Prime Minister had jumped the shark when he appeared on the theatre set of Lord of the Flies and talked about sticking to his principles, no matter what. But I have to say, there was a new contender in the satire stakes today when I read Tony Abbott talking about how politicians should never break promises.  There is only one reason why this failure to deal with marriage equality has dragged on as long as it has, it is because of the complete failure of leadership and weakness of the Prime Minister of Australia to deal with this issue.  When you think about it, it is not just marriage equality: it is home ownership, it is energy prices, it is the NBN. The weakness and incompetence of this government is something to behold.  And, of course, I think many Australians are increasingly sick of the Prime Minister's excuse on any of these matters: \u00b7         NBN\u00b7         Home ownership\u00b7         Energy prices\u00b7         Marriage equality\u00b7         Rising inequality in this countryIt is that shoulder-shrugging style of his which says: \"What do you expect me to do about it? I'm only the Prime Minister\". But anyway, enough of talking about what is going on down the corridor.  We have got a big job to do for the Australian people now that parliament resumes.Of course, foremost amongst that is tackling the growing inequality in this country, growing meaningful and secure jobs for all Australians. I want to give a shout out amongst all of the others, I want to give a bit of a shout out here to Jenny Macklin, to Wayne Swan and Andrew Leigh who have been doing the early and important thinking on inequality. When we talk about inequality and growing inequality, we don't just mean the gap between the rich and the poor.  We also talk about the inequality between first home owners, or prospective first home buyers and their parents on one side of the equation and the property investors subsidised by the Turnbull Government on the other.  When we talk about growing inequality, we talk about the fact that on one hand millionaires are getting tax cuts under this government, large multinationals are getting $65 billion in giveaways, but millions of working Australians have had no wage rise for the last three years.  We talk about inequality, we talk about the gender gap in the pay that men and women in this country receive and the unfair deal that women are getting.  We talk about the gap when it comes to the deal which people living in the regions are getting on NBN, compared to some of the suburbs in the city.  We talk about the gap between our First Australians and the inadequate and unfair outcomes they're getting in health, education and nearly every indicator, and other Australians.  So, we resume this session of parliament invigorated with the momentum of knowing that we will put inequality, not only on the map in terms of talking to about it and tackling it, we are going to put forward positive policies.  Not for us, an opposition who just hopes to be competitive at the next election because of the incompetence, the weakness and the failures of this government - but because we want to offer a positive vision for this country.  Not for us, the nostalgia of the past - but policies focused on the future of all Australians.  At the end of the day, when we talk about inequality, what we mean is we want to make sure that this generation of Australians don't hand on a lesser quality of life, a lesser standard of living, a lesser fair go to the next generation.  For us, inequality is not just a word that someone has used overseas. For us, it is 130 years of our DNA in the labour movement. We have always been fighting for those with less power in society.  And, as has been shown from Chris Bowen and the economics team, right across to Mark Butler and our efforts on climate change, right across to all of the work we're doing education led by Tanya Plibersek and the whole approach in healthcare and every other area we're talking about. We are up for improving the chances and the equality of all Australians and we are going to give it our best shot this session, aren't we?

Premier Mark McGowan said \"The freeze on TAFE fees was an important election commitment that I'm pleased we have delivered. \"The huge increases in fees have prevented young Western Australians from getting the training they need to enter the workforce. \"We recognise the importance of TAFE in preparing young Western Australians for the best possible start to their working lives.   \"Today's announcement will encourage Western Australians into training to create more opportunities in important industries.\" Education and Training Minister Sue Ellery said that \"At a time of economic stress and a soft labour market, we should be encouraging people into the training sector. \"The previous government's TAFE fee increases put TAFE out of reach for many Western Australians. \"The McGowan Government's TAFE fee freeze will encourage Western Australians back into the training sector and create more jobs.\"", "Anne Aly's back with another Story Time - this time with a message for Malcolm Turnbull!! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "Fantastic national recognition of our WA Labor volunteers, campaign teams, candidates and unions. #WeAreWALabor", "If \ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\udc4f get \ud83d\udc4f this \ud83d\udc4f then \ud83d\udc4f maybe \ud83d\udc4f this \ud83d\udc4f is \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\udc4f job \ud83d\udc4f for \ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\udc4f #WeAreWALabor", "Congratulations to Bill Leadbetter, who has just been elected to fill the casual vacancy for the remainder of the 2013 Legislative Council.", "#WeAreWALabor", "Congratulations Emily Hamilton on winning the seat of Joondalup!", "Congratulations Jessica Stojkovska for Kingsley on winning the seat of Kingsley!", "Congratulations Robyn Clarke - WA Labor for Murray-Wellington on winning the seat of Murray-Wellington!", "Congratulations Yaz Mubarakai for Jandakot on winning the seat of Jandakot! #yazwecan", "Congratulations Kevin Michel for Pilbara on winning the seat of Pilbara!", "There's never been a better time to get involved - join WA Labor today!", "Congratulations Mark Folkard for Burns Beach on winning the seat of Burns Beach!", "To every WA Labor candidate, volunteer, supporter and voter - yesterday's result just wouldn't have been possible without you.Thank you! #WeAreWALabor", "Congratulations to Matthew Hughes for Kalamunda on winning the seat of Kalamunda!", "Congratulations to Lisa O'Malley on winning the seat of Bicton!", "Congratulations to Simon Millman for Mount Lawley on winning the seat of Mount Lawley!", "With 30 seats decided in our favour, WA Labor WILL form the next Government of Western Australia and Mark McGowan MP will be our Premier.Thank you Western Australia.

This small clutch of petroleum companies neither pays for our gas, nor pays income tax on the profits made on the export of our gas, nor provides gas to Australia.It is open to you today to announce a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 policy on all retention leases granted and to impose conditions on the production licenses including: an Australian Gas Reserve Policy and a royalty regime of 10%. These conditions would not represent a sovereign risk to companies because the conditions would be known before the final investment decision related to the production license.Failure to announce such a policy now simply continues the weak and failed policies of the past and condemns Australians to lower living standard and high levels of unemployment. It would mean our natural advantage in abundant natural gas will continue to be given to other countries. Effectively you will be giving away jobs.  The endless talk by Government about meeting international agreements on carbon emissions is of no interest to me or the 18% of Queenslanders who support One Nation. We want market intervention to address the failed gas market, but we believe the Government has made a mistake to introduce what it calls the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM).Let me say that calling your policy the ADGSM in no way changes the fact that export control is a form of Domestic Gas Reservation along with Domestic Production Obligation (used in WA) or Acreage Retention. The fact is that both the Coalition and Labor have Gas Reservation Policies (as does One Nation). The Government intervention announced to date involves:\u2022 Export control (ADGSM) and\u2022 Increased onshore coal seam gas production or other unconventional gas production (by penalising the States with bans on this activity etc.).These strategies are short term and simply allow the likes of the Queensland cartel of LNG producers to offset their export losses by gouging the East Coast consumers.  We both know that Victoria is a net exporter of conventional gas to other States. Just look at the gas bulletin board on the AEMO site www.gasbb.com.au to see Victoria exports gas and does not need to pursue unconventional gas. In any event the sole project off the coast will deliver 25 Peta Joules from 2019.The real gas problem is in Queensland and NSW where Australians pay two to three times the ACCC recommended price of $5.87 per/gigajoule. If you persist in doing nothing about Commonwealth owned gas in retention licenses, some as old as 30 years, then you will lose Government and we will see Bill Shorten Prime Minister.  I do not understand how you can persist with the present approach of suggesting it\u2019s a State problem when the Commonwealth owns abundant proven and probable gas in old retention licenses.  We have already been approached by more than one company who would start immediately to go into production if the Government announced a \u2018use it or lose it \u2018policy. The majority of the retention licenses are in the hands of a small cartel but it is the Commonwealth through its senior role with Joint Authorities which calls the tune on a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 policy on old retention leases.  Further, the government could pay for a feasibility study for a second re-gassing station on the East Coast.  AGL has shown with its decision to re-gas at Cribb Point in Western Port Bay in Victoria that re-gassing LNG is cheaper than unconventional gas even after chilling and transport. As you know I briefed you on this issue not so long ago and while you listened without interruption and said it was interesting you have done nothing at all and in the meantime thousands of homes have been cut off for failure to pay world high prices and business are about to shut and thousands will be looking for jobs you sent offshore.Yours sincerelySenator Pauline Hanson---END---#PaulineHanson #OneNation #MalcolmTurnbull #AlanJones #2gb #Gas #CSG #NaturalGas #GasCrisis 2GB 873 - Sydney Talk Radio \u2014 Products shown: Official Supporter\u2019s Tee, Sticker: Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Embroided Patch - One Nation, Plane Shaped Stress Ball, Official Supporter\u2019s Cap and Become a Member.", "As you're all aware, since before I was elected I've been pushing for a major overhaul of Family Law in this country.

My heartfelt sympathy is with all those affected.UK Police have declared it a terrorist-related incident and confirmed it involved an improvised explosive device causing flash burns.29 people are reported injured but thankfully at this stage none are believed to be in a serious or life-threatening condition. We know only too well that London\u2019s first responders will be doing everything they can to look after those affected.As the police investigation and search for the perpetrators continues, the United Kingdom terror threat has been upgraded from severe to critical. I can confirm that Australia\u2019s terror threat level remains at Probable, and I urge Australians to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the National Security Hotline on 1800 123 400. Our High Commissioner in London has advised that he is not aware of any Australians hurt in this attack, but will continue to make urgent enquiries with UK authorities and provide consular assistance to any Australians who may have been caught up in the incident. If you have any concerns for the welfare of family and friends in the area, you should attempt to contact them directly.If you are unable to contact them and still hold concerns for their welfare, you should call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135, or +61 2 6261 3305 (if calling from overseas).Just this week I spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May. Among other security issues we reflected on our visit to the Borough Market in July where two young Australians were among those murdered by Islamist terrorists. At the G20, Australia, with strong support from the UK, successfully ensured the 20 largest economies endorsed a strong statement of solidarity in the battle against terrorism and, in particular, on the need to ensure the internet is not used as a platform to promote it. Our two nations have the closest cooperation on security and intelligence matters. We are constantly consulting with and learning from each other. The UK has suffered five terrorist attacks this year, and only a few months ago our agencies disrupted a plot in Sydney to blow up an aeroplane.Our citizens must be able to live their lives and enjoy the freedoms we all hold so dear.The national strategy for protecting crowded places  was released in August and was the result of a direction I gave last year following the Nice truck bomb attack. It is an extensive set of tools and strategies to protect crowded places and, while led by the Commonwealth Government, was a collaboration with all states and territories, local government and the private sector. I thank them all for their commitment. Theresa May and I discussed the strategy in our call this week, and its significance. I thanked her for the assistance of UK agencies, together with other international partners, in its preparation. Keeping the public safe from terrorism is, and must always be, a concerted national effort. That's why I am hosting a special counter terrorism COAG meeting with the States and Territories on 5 October, where I will be joined by all First Ministers to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep Australians safe. There is no room for \u2018set and forget\u2019 when it comes to national security. The Coalition Government has strengthened our national security laws, with 9 new tranches of legislation passed through the Parliament since 2014, helping to prevent 13 major terror plots. The new laws have enabled suspected terrorists to be caught earlier, ensured convicted terrorists who continue to pose a high risk to the public will stay behind bars for longer and empowered the ADF to target and kill a wider range of terrorists in the Middle East conflict zone.  We will continue to adapt and modernise to ensure our law enforcement and security agencies, the best in the world, have the powers they need. This includes establishing a Home Affairs portfolio to ensure even closer collaboration between our domestic security agencies. My number one priority, and that of my Government, is to keep Australians safe and to preserve our freedoms and our way of life.", "More jobs, the biggest media reforms in decades, strengthening No Jab, No Pay and breakfast with the Qantas Wallabies.

This is what Stalin did. When he fell out with his henchmen he didn\u2019t just execute them, they were removed from all official photographs - they became non-persons, banished not just from life\u2019s mortal coil but from memory and history itself. Tearing down or defacing statues of our colonial era explorers and governors is not much better than that. Of course Cook didn\u2019t \u201cdiscover\u201d Australia anymore than Columbus \u201cdiscovered\u201d America or Marco Polo \"discovered\" China. I knew that when as a schoolboy I first read the inscription. The statue gives a perspective of history from the time it was erected - 1879. Just as a history text in the Mitchell Library from the same era would do. Is the next step of this new totalitarianism to burn the 19th century histories of Australia as well, or should their yellowing pages be simply overwritten in crude graffiti condemning their long dead authors?Old histories should not be burned, anymore than old statues should be torn down. Rather they should be challenged and complemented by new histories, fresh evidence and modern monuments. Statues, inscriptions, monuments are all part of our history not simply because of what they record but of how it is recorded. We do not adopt every inscription on every statue or monument - it is a voice at a point in time.How many ancient Roman monuments show slaves shackled to the chariot wheels of their Roman conquerors? Does that mean modern Italians endorse slavery? Or chariots? Old statues and monuments which tell one version of events offer the opportunity to tell another. It might be another new monument nearby or an interpretative panel, after all contention and controversy enliven history. We have created here in Australia the most successful multicultural society in the world. Our citizens include our first Australians whose ancestors have lived here for 65,000 years and the newest baby in the arms of a migrant mother proudly holding her certificate of citizenship.Our history is a rich and complex one. Overwhelmingly it is one of courage, hard work, enterprise and success - we have much more to celebrate than we have to regret.Yes, there are many dark chapters of injustice, hardship and cruelty. And none crueller or more unjust than the dispossession of our first Australians. But we do not advance the clear eyed telling of the truth as we see it today, by trying to obliterate the reality of the different perspectives of times past. A free society debates its history, it does not deny it.It writes new books, it does not burn old ones.It builds new monuments as it preserves old ones.And above all, a free society recognises that the history each generation makes, and writes, builds upon the ones that came before to create our nation\u2019s remarkable Australian story.", "Daffodil Day raises funds for cancer research, prevention, support services & advocacy.

Despite all of this, we came through it.  We bonded together all across the country and each city saw record crowds hit the streets to march and rally in solidarity.  Above all that we saw some really wonderful ways in which our straight allies went about to show they stand with us.  Painted fences and houses, ribbons on cars, a huge sea of rainbow posters and flags sprawled on shop windows, sport complexes, auto-mechanics, aeroplanes, shopping centres and pavements.  We take solace in knowing that we lived through a horrendous act of failure of the Government which delivered so much pain and suffering for our community, but we know that as we lived through this we also got to see our country take a stand against homophobia and show their colourful support of our relationships and love.

Some struggled with having their gender viewed as disordered, or experienced gender dysphoria, meaning discussions of genitalia could be distressing.The report cites US-based YouTuber Kat Blaque, who takes issue with assumptions about anatomy based on gender. \u201cYou know not all girls have genitalia that people expect girls to have \u2014 not all boys have the genitalia that people expect for boys,\u201d she says.Another subject suggests the term \u201cerectile tissue\u201d could describe both the penis and clitoris.\u201cEducators and sexuality education programs must \u2026 develop ways of talking about bodies and intimacy that shift attention away from the normative association of particular genders with particular anatomies,\u201d the report says.\u201cImportantly ... the language of sperm and eggs can produce dysphoria for some young transgender people. It is entirely possible ... to speak about combining the two gametes as resulting in a pregnancy, without referring to egg and sperm per se.\u201dDr Riggs, an associate professor in social work, said while the idea might be difficult to understand, it was possible to talk about \u201cthe different things our bodies do without having to name them in a gendered way\u201d.\u201cAs a parent of children, I know these are difficult conversations to have with children as they involve using words that not everyone is comfortable using,\u201d he said. \u201cBut actually it opens up the possibility for those parents \u2026 to say \u2018these things can happen\u2019 \u2014 STIs, pregnancy \u2014 without having to get tripped up with the language.\u201dDr Riggs, the Australian Research Council Future Fellow and national convener of the Australian Psychological Society\u2019s gay and lesbian interest group, said sexuality education in schools had nothing to do with same-sex marriage and it was disappointing to see them linked in public debate.\u201cIf we can reduce HIV ... reduce unwanted pregnancies and reduce kids being coerced into having sex they don\u2019t want to have, including transgender kids, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said.

Indeed, it seems they think rejection of the religious argument is fundamental to the success of their campaign. This is alarming because it implies the Yes case depends on persuading the public of a false proposition.The government and parliament, despite years of emotional debate, declined to address the wider religious freedom question. The political class engaged instead in a great pretence: that the only such issue concerned the wedding ceremony and protections in the Marriage Act for clergy and celebrants, an extremely narrow view of religious freedom.Given legalisation of same-sex marriage means the laws of the state and laws of most religions will be brought into direct conflict over society\u2019s most essential institution, the one certainty is ongoing legal and political trench warfare over the balance between acceptance of the same-sex marriage norm and the scope for freedom of belief and religion.There is a litany of examples from the overseas experience. Fatuous remarks that \u201cthe world hasn\u2019t come to an end\u201d in countries that have legislated same-sex marriage are just that \u2014 and designed to deceive.Having refused to confront the issue the advocates of the Yes case now get agitated and self-righteous when it has become an issue in the plebiscite. This was inevitable. While some aspects of the No case are obnoxious, its warnings about religious freedoms risks are entirely valid. What matters is that the many highly intelligent political champions of the Yes case are trapped: they are selling a shoddy intellectual bill of goods and many of them know it.The first point is that religious freedom guarantees in this country are inadequate. This was agreed and documented in February\u2019s Senate select committee report. Unlike many Western nations, Australia has no statutory expression of a stand-alone right to religious freedom. There are far greater legal protections in relation to sexual orientation than in relation to religious belief.This is an anomaly given that under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights freedom of religion is an inviolable right. The risk now is our parliament undermining Australia\u2019s commitment to the ICCPR.Evidence presented to the Senate committee shows that statutory protection of religious belief is weak both in federal law and a number of states. It mainly exists as \u201cexemptions\u201d from anti-discrimination law. The Anglican Diocese of Sydney made the obvious point to the committee that this failed to treat freedom of belief and religion as a fundamental human right. Marriage Alliance said: \u201cWe submit that religious freedom is a fundamental human right (and) that framing a debate in terms of exemptions misunderstands this fact.\u201dThere was strong support in submissions for parliament to leg\u00adislate to enshrine religious guarantees as a protected attribute in federal anti-discrimination law. This is the pivotal point. The committee unanimously agreed there was a \u201cneed to enhance current protections for religious freedom\u201d. The Human Rights Law Centre said: \u201cReligious freedom should be protected in law. Indeed, we are on record in a number of inquiries supporting the addition of religious belief to protections under federal anti-discrimination law.\u201dCommittee chairman Liberal David Fawcett warned that \u201cif Australia is to remain a plural, tolerant society where different views are valued and legal\u201d then such action on religious freedom is essential. What was the reaction of the Turnbull government and Labor to the Senate report?It varied between disregard and contempt. The reason is apparent \u2014 politics. Labor has abandoned any interest in addressing the inadequacy of religious protection laws with its embrace of the LGBTI cause. As for the Coalition, the story is the weakness of its conservative caucus. The deeper point is the churches are vulnerable and the politicians know it.The lamentable situation was summarised by the University of Sydney\u2019s Patrick Parkinson: \u201cThere have been numerous bills introduced into parliament to enact same-sex marriage over the last few years and what has been common to most of them has been a minimalist protection for freedom of conscience.\u201dThe second core conclusion is that this battle over rights will continue after same-sex marriage is legislated. In Denmark the Lutheran Church has had its rights restricted. The Swedish PM has said priests should no more be allowed to refuse to marry same-sex couples than medical professionals should be exempt from abortion procedures. The Speaker of the British House of Commons says \u201cproper equal marriage\u201d won\u2019t happen until the churches are compelled to obey by law. Australian Greens formally say they want the religious exemptions in anti-discrimination law to be wound back. Many in the ALP left have the same view.We are being put on notice. You would have to be politically blind to deny the reality (an option many politicians have deliberately chosen). The post-same-sex marriage battle is already under way. This is because while many people genuinely see same-sex marriage as an issue of non-discrimination, this was never its essence. It is an ideological cause seeking fundamental changes in Western society, laws and norms. It will continue apace after the law is changed.Marriage equality is an ideology and ideologies, by nature, do not settle for compromise victories. As Benjamin Law says in Quarterly Essay: Moral Panic 101: \u201cIt might be stating the obvious but same-sex marriage is far from the final frontier in the battle against homophobia.\u201d The struggle will continue \u2014 in schools and in institutions. Law says the two biggest LGBTI issues are Safe Schools and same-sex marriage.He says Safe Schools is \u201csupposed to discomfort people\u201d by up-ending how we see gender and sexuality. He talks about exploding accepted norms with queer theory, inviting \u201cpeople to reconsider why anyone should be obliged to identify as female or male at all\u201d. The aim is to introduce Safe Schools across the country and make it compulsory.The pretence by Yes case politicians that the plebiscite has no consequences for the Safe Schools program treats us like fools. Legislation of same-sex marriage will tilt the scales decisively in this struggle between sexual rights and religious freedom. This legal and cultural change will influence decision-makers everywhere \u2014 public servants, corporates, media and educational institutions.The churches will remain a prime target and the fact their protections are weak makes them highly vulnerable once the assault gains momentum.The Yes case bases its campaign on human rights but misses the exquisite irony that you cannot cherry-pick human rights and keep your integrity. As Parkinson said, consistency of principle means those who justify their campaign on human rights need to give proper consideration to how rights can be balanced.That hasn\u2019t happened in Australia, not even remotely. Every sign is Australia will legalise same-sex marriage devoid of any serious attention to religious freedom issues and, as a result, religious protections will be exposed and sacrificed.The politicians are doing this because they think they can get away with it. They are entitled to that judgment. What they are not entitled to is a gross deception. The assurances they give on religious protection are worthless \u2014 their inaction proves that.

Sure, but we can talk about what has actually occurred.When same-sex marriage was legalised in Massachusetts, children were given literature including that said it's a myth that marriage is about children and a myth that children are best served when raised by a mother and father. When parents complained about a picture book shown to children with a same-sex couple kissing, their school said that they'd continue to read these books. They took the matter to the court but the court found that schools now have an obligation to normalise same-sex marriage.In Canada, law graduates from a Christian university are refused admission to practise in certain parts of the country because the university holds the view that marriage is between a man and a woman.Three months ago in England, a Jewish school failed three inspections as they didn't teach about homosexuality and gender diversity, and therefore as same-sex marriage is legal, the students were not being provided a full understanding of fundamental British values. And that school now faces closure.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has previously committed a future Labor government to winding back religious freedom protections offered in any same-sex marriage legislation.Labor would also establish an LGBTIQ watchdog funded by taxpayers to monitor and take action against Australians. And last week, a petition was set up to deregister Dr Pansy Lai, who challenged the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the Coalition for Marriage's television advertisement.And this is while same-sex marriage still remains unlawful.In all the arguments of the \"yes\" campaign, they don't talk about what impact same-sex marriage has had on basic freedoms.Clearly there are significant consequences in terms of the impact on free speech, religious freedom and the rights of parents \u2013 and this is just at the beginning when same-sex marriage has only been legal for a short period of time in a minority of countries.What happens when a whole generation who have grown up with same-sex marriage and gender theory as the norm become the legislators?", "Marriage Alliance, via our campaign partner Coalition for Marriage, has launched a campaign handbook which is available to download for free.

Indeed, it seems they think rejection of the religious argument is fundamental to the success of their campaign. This is alarming because it implies the Yes case depends on persuading the public of a false proposition.The government and parliament, despite years of emotional debate, declined to address the wider religious freedom question. The political class engaged instead in a great pretence: that the only such issue concerned the wedding ceremony and protections in the Marriage Act for clergy and celebrants, an extremely narrow view of religious freedom.Given legalisation of same-sex marriage means the laws of the state and laws of most religions will be brought into direct conflict over society\u2019s most essential institution, the one certainty is ongoing legal and political trench warfare over the balance between acceptance of the same-sex marriage norm and the scope for freedom of belief and religion.There is a litany of examples from the overseas experience. Fatuous remarks that \u201cthe world hasn\u2019t come to an end\u201d in countries that have legislated same-sex marriage are just that \u2014 and designed to deceive.The pretence by Yes case politicians that the plebiscite has no consequences for the Safe Schools program treats us like fools. Legislation of same-sex marriage will tilt the scales decisively in this struggle between sexual rights and religious freedom. This legal and cultural change will influence decision-makers everywhere \u2014 public servants, corporates, media and educational institutions.The churches will remain a prime target and the fact their protections are weak makes them highly vulnerable once the assault gains momentum.The Yes case bases its campaign on human rights but misses the exquisite irony that you cannot cherry-pick human rights and keep your integrity. As Parkinson said, consistency of principle means those who justify their campaign on human rights need to give proper consideration to how rights can be balanced.That hasn\u2019t happened in Australia, not even remotely. Every sign is Australia will legalise same-sex marriage devoid of any serious attention to religious freedom issues and, as a result, religious protections will be exposed and sacrificed.The politicians are doing this because they think they can get away with it. They are entitled to that judgment. What they are not entitled to is a gross deception. The assurances they give on religious protection are worthless \u2014 their inaction proves that.

Jack was violently abused (not sexually) by his step father.  Three children were born from this marriage and 2 ended up with mental illnesses.  So Jack now had 3 half brothers.

Jack had a degenerative disease.  When Jack was denied the right to have any relationship with his biological father; he was denied the right to know his biological parent's genealogy.  Jack's step father in his senior years took revenge on his wife and her relatives for lying to him about Jack.   Jack hated his half siblings and decided to steal all their inheritance and destroy their lives. He did succeed.

I was outwardly gracious toward the LGBTI community, but my actual position on this would have best been described as; \u2018love the sinner, hate the sin\u2019. My opinion was slow to change, I remember saying to my friend quite arrogantly, \u201cI attended 4 years of theological college, we argued these types of issues and I\u2019ve already made my mind up on this.\u201d He persisted, loaned me books, we watched DVDs on the issue. One day I said \u201cI guess I can see that some LGBTI people are just born that way, and who are we to judge? You know like a child born with a genetic sickness, we don\u2019t exclude them from church.\u201d He was patient with me and asked how my gay friends might feel having their sexuality likened to a sickness? He asked if my sexuality might be seen the same way? This challenged me to further bible study and wider study on this topic in general. The needle kept shifting as I came to understand a whole new and solid way of seeing this area. I saw myself in a way I had never seen in the past, and I didn\u2019t like what I saw \u2013 superiority and arrogance around my \u2018being\u2019. Not just in my sexuality but as a privileged white middle class male. I needed to change.About 2 years after I had come \u2018full circle\u2019 and come to fully love and embrace LGBTI people as my equal, my own child told me he was transgender, he no longer wanted to live as a woman, but felt he was a man.

Evan and David remember the response well. \u201cThe process of discernment was deeply supportive, both of us as the engaged couple, and of those in the Meeting who were considering the issue of same sex marriage for the first time.

These programs are based on a fundamental lie, and are intrinsically homophobic,\u201d said Rev Dr Margaret Mayman, Chair of Australian Christians for Marriage Equality.\u201cSadly, Mr Shelton\u2019s comments show that deep aversion to, and a refusal to accept the existence of, LGBTI orientation and identity is at the heart of the opposition to marriage equality for many,\u201d Dr Mayman said.\u201cWe call on all leaders of the Church who are encouraging a \u2018no\u2019 vote to publicly reject Mr Shelton\u2019s  dangerous and damaging words.

It has been directly linked to the suicides of many LGBTIQ Australians.\u201d\u201cThe members of Brave have been through every process imaginable to try to change their sexuality and have found that that is a dead-end that only leads to harm and devastation.

Loving relationships are at the core of our Christian faith and we believe, the most treasured gift God has given to us (and all humanity). First and foremost, the possibility that we can have a relationship with Jesus who has set for us an example of what infinite love and acceptance is all about. We believe we can reciprocate (albeit in a comparatively limited way) that love for Jesus by truly seeking to love one another and ourselves. For this reason, we will be voting \u201cyes\u201d in the upcoming marriage equality survey.To be honest, our vote would not always have been \u201cyes\u201d.  There would have been a time, as Bible believing Christians (which we still are!) that we would have thought to vote \u201cyes\u201d would have been going against what God would want. That is no longer the case for us. We are not theologians but we believe with the Holy Spirit\u2019s help, we have one mediator to teach us how the Holy Scriptures can guide our lives and our decision making, and that person is Jesus.Our change of heart (and vote!) has come about through the close relationships we are blessed to have with our lesbian, gay and bisexual family members, friends, colleagues and occasionally (and we feel sad that it is so rare) with those we worship with in our church. Fellow Christians who have felt for their emotional and spiritual safety, that they must keep their sexuality hidden from almost everyone.  It is our deepening relationship with Jesus and with others that has bought about our change of heart.Not that long ago, we too would have glibly said, \u201cwe love the sinner but we hate their sin\u2019. It is something we have had to apologise and seek forgiveness for, from both Jesus and those who would have received our shallow platitude. We have no doubt, that as the author Justin Lee, said in his book Torn: Rescuing the Gospel from the Gays-vs-Christian Debate, a far more Christ-like response would be to \u201clove the sinner and hate the sin in me\u201d.When our son first openly shared his homosexuality with us, he had chosen to be celibate and was praying that God would \u201cheal him\u201d. For many years, he and many well-meaning friends (and his parents) prayed that same prayer. We have now come to understand that God did not heal our son because he was not sick! He was and is, a beautiful young man made in the image of God. For many years we pondered if it was OK for Christians to be homosexual only if they remained celibate. However, we came to the realisation that God has created us with the desire to be in relationship; relationship with Jesus and relationship with each other and significantly, relationship with a sexually intimate partner. We had our union blessed by God, our family and friends 45 years ago. Our other son and daughter had their marriage vows acknowledged in the same way.

I have just been to a conference of  therapists from Australia and New Zealand. At the conference a motion was brought forward in support of marriage equality. I found myself taking a photo of the motion and happily sending it to Trish (my partner of 19 years) and happily stating 'look where I found support for us'! In the break that followed a woman I had had a little contact with came up to me and stated, with disdain in her voice, \"we are becoming so political!\" I felt my heart sink, and with the steadiest voice I could muster said \"I personally found the support uplifting,\" and walked away. I shared this in my small process group. These are people I had just met at the conference. The older women in the group then spoke. One told the story of having to move around NZ regularly because of her husband\u2019s work. She explained that as soon as she landed in a place, the first thing she would do was join the library. She was told by the librarian \u2018have the form signed by your husband and then you can get your card\u2019. Another told me that she had to terminate her employment when she got married, another spoke about how she lost her credit card once she got married because she had to get one under her husband\u2019s name. These women turned to me, with a look of understanding and love. We know what you are going through. At another point, a man in the group stated frankly, \"I am sick of getting queer kids out of the river, it is time to act.\"Like never before, I am understanding the enormity of what is taking place. The message I have received incessantly my whole life is that if I am queer, I am not the same or as good as you. This is the message we all receive; the insidious shame hovers and is suffocating. Some would be astounded, since being gay is not such an issue these days. I disagree and in this so called \u2018debate\u2019 we are giving everyone a vote on whether I am good enough to have the right to marry the person I have chosen to live my life with, the one I have chosen to be by my side and who knows my heart. I still hear people say this is a debate that needs to be argued. Be careful, you are treading on tender territory, hearts that have fought their whole lives, new ones that are still working out who they are \u2026 they are all listening and the only thing they will hear is \u2018am I good enough?\u2019.", "Australian Christians for Marriage Equality is clear that the issue before us is civil marriage law.

That these two identities do not overlap. And this is incorrect.  I have known Amanda for nine years and she is the most humble, intelligent, and thoughtful human being I've ever met. We fell in love soon and got married in Los Angles in 2014, then moved to Australia from China at the end of 2015.  We have a daughter who is in Year 10 now. Amanda is my soul mate, and we love each other in Lord. We are so blessed to form a family in love. When in China, once the church wanted to drive us out due to our support of LGBT community. But we successfully persuaded the church chief minister that they misinterpreted the Bible, and we were able to stay. It makes me think that if we keep having dialogues with fellow Christians, they may change their opinions on LGBT issues. Since in Australia, we are openly out to the affirming church community. Some church friends, who did not have lesbian friends before, noticed Amanda and I respected and cared for each other, just like all the married couples. They changed their mind and told us we should be able to get married in Australia. See, sometimes change is not too difficult.  God loves us as we are. As LGBT Christians, we stand firm and fight for Australian marriage equality.

Apples and Navels appear to be selling slowly and there is more Australian stonefruit about. This early stone fruit is eating quite well but it\u2019s mostly small. The smaller it is the cheaper it is. Mangoes continue to be the dominant fruit line and as this week moves on there will be plenty of R2E2s and Calypsos on offer in addition to my favourite, the KPs.In melons, the rockmelon crop from far North Queensland is coming to an end before we move down to central Queensland where the fruit is often not as good. Being the end of the crop means smaller fruit but as is the case this week it\u2019s the tastiest fruit, and cheap too. The same applies to Honeydews. Seedless watermelon is getting less expensive as we source from a bit further south also. Avocados continue to amaze us with their price and I suspect they will be dear at least until Christmas.In veg, perfect growing weather continues across the country. Asparagus leads the charge with prices falling again this week for a superb quality product. Still, plenty of tomatoes and even truss will ease in price this week. Cauliflower, fennel and broccoli continue to be well supplied and there is lots of excellent local lettuce around this week. I see Lebanese cucumbers easing this week, those tasty baby cukes will lead the way here. Bunches of beetroot, English spinach and Dutch carrots are all a real bargain.

In berries, there are a few good and well-priced raspberries in the markets, this is mostly the early NSW fruit and will not really get cheap until next month, but it is fresh good quality fruit. This week we start to transition to Western Australia for strawberries. The fruit is not as ripe as the Queensland fruit which is fast coming to the end of its season. The next month sees a small quantity of very good eating local Sydney Basin strawberries as well. All the imported grapes this week are good. The red Scarlet seedless grapes are my pick for the week. Blueberries are still great but there\u2019s not quite as many available as in the last fortnight. For an exceptionally good eating product, we have some new season Queensland white peaches this week. It\u2019s hard to grow fruit out of season and can only be done in areas outside our traditional stonefruit areas. These Queenslanders look like they might have worked out a different peach that will succeed and extend our Australian season with good eating fruit.It's Spring and the weathers great and so are the vegetables. Asparagus is so good and so well priced this week.

They are a cross between a mandarin and a grapefruit. Very easy to peel, sweet flavour. Definitely worth a try. Great in salads with fennel and red onions, they are a versatile fruit. All our stores will have a very inexpensive option either on the regular stack or as an imperfect pick this week. They are really worth a try, this is the best time of the year for good eating, good keeping tangelos.\"", "\ud83c\udf4a D A V E ' S \ud83c\udf45 M A R K E T \ud83c\udf47 U P D A T E \ud83c\udf45 this week he says ...\"The mangoes continue to roll in. This is the best Northern Territory season I can remember. Now is when a lot of the better growers get underway, these farms are further away from the coast, they tend to pick when the fruit is mature, not just to chase the early high prices and the weather up there remains perfect for the fruit.The other product having an extraordinary season is the imported grapes. There seems to be a new variety of grape from there every week. These varieties are often quite similar but ripen earlier or later than the traditional varieties. My pick of the grapes this week is an early white variety, the Timpson seedless. They are sweet and good and ripen a week or so earlier than the traditional Thompson variety which are in the markets now but in our view maybe a week too early. Scarletts are the best of the red varieties and the blacks are good too but the whites are the pick of the three. Similar to last week, there are many different pears all at their best right now. I talked about Tangelos in my pick of the week, definitely worth a try. Great spring weather continues for veg. A word of warning though a good number of our growers are now looking for rain to fill their dams for summer. Plenty of time still for that but we do need it to happen. In the meantime let's enjoy what we have. Imperfect eggplant, mostly the old-fashioned varieties have really tumbled in price this week. The newer varieties mostly grown in glasshouse have been able to maintain their price.Chillies are also coming on strongly as they do in Spring. Leeks, fennel and spinach are all good value. Asparagus continues to flood into the market I can't understand why the major supermarkets insist on continuing with imported product when such top quality Australian product is readily available. Lebanese cucumbers are easing in price and should be cheap next week. Finally, those snacking tomatoes which are so good to eat continue at cheap prices. I really don\u2019t know why you would pay near the same money as you do for truss tomatoes as you do for these fantastic small tomatoes.\"", "\ud83d\udc99 Good morning best blueberries ever!!

Our premium mangoes are the best, no exceptions the best. Our trays and imperfects do have blemishes on the skin but guess what, no one I know eats the skin. They both represent incredible value. Murcotts I have written about in my Pick of the Week post.Two other interesting changes this week are firstly Queensland rockmelons, really good eating varieties and well-priced somewhat smaller than the fruit we have been selling. The extra-large rockmelons are still from the Northern Territory. The other huge price change is in our imported United States grapes. There are no Australian grapes now and for the 6 or 8 weeks, we rely on the States. After that, we reciprocate and send ours back to them. Regardless the price this week is around half what it was last week. Blueberries continue to flood the market. For the small amount extra, you pay I recommend our premium blueberry. The variety is bigger and sweeter than the marginally cheaper supermarket varieties. Blood oranges are still fantastic as are apples and pears, in the pear offerings the Corellas are really good this week.In veg, it\u2019s still a typical spring in the Sydney markets. Oversupply of good quality vegetables and somewhat subdued trading waiting for warmer weather to settle in. So heaps of bargains across the board, leeks, spinach, English spinach, all cucumbers, Australian asparagus, tomatoes (except truss), broccoli, Broccolini, snow peas, chokoes, Dutch carrots, sweet corn and many others. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with so many fresh, cheap new season spring vegetables.\"", "\"The Honey Murcott mandarins are eating absolutely superbly. This to me is the best mandarin of the year. They are definitely the sweetest of all mandarins and more consistent than the very popular Imperials where no matter how carefully we select them, the nature of their rootstock means the odd dry one gets through. Not so the Murcotts which are juicy, sweet and good sized fruit.Unfortunately, they\u2019re not as easy to peel as Imperials and they do have a lot of seeds. People of my generation think seeds in grapes and other fruit is the norm but the under 45-year-olds don\u2019t. So spit the seeds out, go to the trouble of peeling them and be rewarded. These next three weeks they are still fresh off the tree and at their absolute best.

Raspberries and blackberries are both very good and strawberries have picked up a bit in their taste profile this week. September is always the best time of the year for green kiwi and this is the case again this year.Honey Murcott mandarins are being highly sought after on the export markets so won\u2019t get cheap this year but I have eaten a few this week, they are just such a treat. Blood oranges are at their peak, if you love them like I do then grab a few weeks\u2019 worth and put them in your fridge.

Often the really early fruit is not so good and we have to wait for Katherine fruit to really enjoy a mango. Not so this year. They are good and sweet and they are very reasonably priced. With berries this week I have found the strawberries, though extremely cheap, a bit disappointing to eat. On the other hand, the blueberries are fantastic and also cheap. My recommendation, buy blueberries not strawberries.My other recommendation is to juice or eat a blood orange. A bit cheaper this week we are enjoying the best of the season right now. There\u2019s lots of different ways to use them but as a straight fresh juice first thing in the morning they can\u2019t be beaten. This is the time of the year that some of the less popular pears come into their own. For a change try a Josephine or a brown pear, the flavour is amazing and they make a nice change from the Packhams we have been eating over the last few months.Similarly, Honey Murcott mandarins make a nice change also. They\u2019re a bit harder to peel but are just so sweet they are worth the effort. The next few months all our grapes are imported from the United States. Personally I can do without them but the best eating of them is definitely the red seedless. Spring next week will mean more mangoes, try a TPP mango if you have not done so previously.With vegies, nothing is really dear and a lot of things are cheap. The best product to me is our Australian asparagus. It is a minimum of two and up to four weeks fresher than the imported product still being sold by some of our major retailers. If the label says product of Peru or Mexico you know you are getting second best. Gourmet tomatoes are probably the cheapest they have been for 5 years and the quality of the truss I have seen is not good, my view is pay less and get better eating tomatoes with the gourmets this week.Lots of other good value in vegetables this week; fennel, Broccolini, broccoli, Iceberg lettuce and Dutch carrots to name a few. However best value for the week is the imported garlic, it\u2019s great, its cheap and there is no satisfactory Australian option at the moment. Half of last week\u2019s price, stock up, it\u2019s two months before the good Aussie product starts. The other real bargain this week is baby or Lebanese eggplant. A very specialised product it is usually double the price of standard eggplant. A lot of retailers don\u2019t stock this line, so when its oversupplied the price collapses.

From Bowen in Far North Queensland the season is well and truly in full swing and the quality doesn\u2019t get any better.\"", "When the toms are this tasty, all they need is a bit of salt, some great quality olive oil and some fresh herbs. #yum #lunch #tomatoes #tasty #salad #harrisfarm #harrisfarmmarkets", "For the cauliflower-crazies out there - yuuummy cheeesy spinach & cauliflower bake!

This week he says \"Extended warm weather conditions in Far North Queensland has seen a considerable spike in banana supply. Strong volumes have been making their way down the highway for the last two weeks resulting in an easing of the market. The quality of fruit is excellent and the eating quality is especially good. Time to put bananas back on the shopping list.\u2800 \u2800For something a little different this week, try our Cara Cara navel oranges. Cara Cara\u2019s are red-fleshed navel orange from the Riverina district in NSW. Cara Cara oranges are generally medium sized, very sweet and low in acidity making them kid-friendly.\u2800 \u2800Good news continues on berries this week. Strong volumes of blueberries have led to a decent drop in Blueberries market. The extra volumes have been created by fantastic growing conditions and the overlapping of different growing districts. Value is only matched by the quality which is exceptional. Dry conditions in south east Queensland is keeping strawberry volumes flowing into the markets. It has been many years since we have seen a season uninterrupted by weather and the result is pristine quality. For unforgettable berry experience, try our premium range of strawberries and blueberries.\u2800 \u2800Seedless melon, rockmelon, honeydew, Packham pears, custard apples and drinking coconuts continue to be well supplied.

Also look for raspberries to ease further over the next few weeks. In other fruit news the market is well supplied with green kiwi, mandarins, seedless melon, navel oranges and rockmelons. Rockmelons at this time of year  come from far North Queensland in the Bowen region where they have yet to experience  winter. Primarily running smaller sizes this has not detracted from the eating quality  also the drop in price has been significant. Seedless melon from Darwin in the Northern Territory is amongst some of the best melon produced in Australia. Sweet and crunchy it\u2019s a shame it comes at a time when demand is flat, however the fruit is eating that good  at present and being great value maybe a good enough reason to give it a go.\u2800.\u2800Vegetable news is the  tale of two states. Much of the NSW grown produce has been adversely affected by frost in the growing areas. Leafy greens have been particularly affected along with  kale, Asian vegetables ,silver beet, bunch beetroot, basil, herbs and rhubarb all feeling the effects of the cold conditions. The situation is the opposite in Queensland where excellent growing conditions are prevailing. As a result we are in a well  supplied market for  tomatoes,  capsicums, lettuce, eggplant, zucchini, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, squash, beans ,broccolini, lettuce, Chinese cabbage and kumera.\"", "Happy Monday everyone!

We have Pink Lady apples, Packham pears, and Imperial mandarins all eating well and at great prices.All berries continue to be well supplied and getting better in value.There is a good supply of passionfruit in the market at the moment coming from Northern NSW around the Tweed River region but there are also strong volumes coming in from Bundaberg and Gympie regions. The varieties we are sourcing are Misty Gems and Sweetheart, which are two of the better eating varieties of passionfruit. There is a decent range of sizes and all are eating perfectly sweet.US cherries have come good. The fruit from the Washington State is fantastic... extra large, plump, crunchy and full of flavour. Look for the Skeena and Sweethearts variety in the stores as they are the freshest fruit in the market. For those of you looking for a taste of summer in the depths of winter, this is absolutely the way to go. A word of warning: there are some cheaper cherries that have some age in the market selling cheaply, purchasing this fruit will almost certainly not lead to a good outcome.The full moon event that occurred late last week provided some excellent growing conditions for vegetable crops due to the extra hours of light. The result is a market well supplied in red and green caps, corn, zucchini, lettuce, English spinach, kale, silverbeet, beetroot, shallots, cabbages, spring onions, zucchini, rhubarb, Chinese vegetables, snow peas and sugar snaps. Quality overall is excellent. Basil, which has been very expensive in recent weeks, has eased considerably to at a much more reasonable price. Gourmet and Roma tomatoes coming from the Bowen district are back in price and quality very good. Truss tomatoes are also flushing at present and prices are very reasonable.\"", "\ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f Roasted Queensland Strawberries \ud83c\udf53\u2764\ufe0f We tossed these gorgeous strawbs in a little balsamic vinegar and some sugar and roasted them for about half an hour.

We also have good raspberries at reasonable prices (until two years ago we either didn\u2019t have them at all from late June to mid August) and superb blackberries... unheard of mid-winter. Topless pineapples, all the apples and citrus are all good. For me though, the berries, kiwi gold, papaya and the imported cherries are just amazing for mid winter breakfast or just to snack on.  Not surprisingly, a lack of demand for salad lines has seen prices retreat in this category. Telegraph cucumbers are the pick of the cues, iceberg lettuce and all tomatoes are cheaper than last week.A couple of very quiet markets this week has seen prices start to drop as stocks build up in several other lines also.

The bottom line is fantastic fruit at fantastic prices. These prices will exert downward pressure on the price of the other berries and so shortly there will be bargains in all berries whilst the rain holds off up North.In citrus, our Navels are really sweet and really good value. Lemons have eased and a number of different mandarin varieties are now underway (I had a Daisy yesterday, it was fantastic). Consider a 3kg net or our imperfect range in the Navels to save money in this area. Just around the corner blood oranges (my juicing favourite) are about to start.Consumers can only eat so many mandarins, so as the number of varieties available grow, prices will continue to ease. Paw Paw and Papaya are both plentiful and eating well. Of course the staple offers of apples and pears continue to be available.In veg, the best news of the week is the easing of tomato prices. This week the gap that the recent cyclone in North Queensland caused has been closed, and the supply side of our industry returns to normal. As always it is the odd sizes and wrong (too ripe or too green) coloured fruit that weakens first. Look for some relatively (to the premium stack) cheaper tomatoes as this week goes on. By next week we will be back to what is the norm for this time of the year.Lots of other lines are either cheaper, better quality or easier to source than they were a week ago. Other lines that are much cheaper include Lebanese and Telegraph cucumbers, Cauliflowers (which are a real bargain this week), Iceberg lettuce, 2 kg bags of Kestrel potatoes, spinach, Imperfect parsnips, red capsicums, celery and rhubarb.
