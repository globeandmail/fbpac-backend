Also, I was told this was where the people with nice hair belonged.\" https://www.facebook.com/LPCO.PLCO/", "Today is #ThursdayTalks with LPC(O) and we'd like to introduce you to Marco Puddu! (pictured far left)\"Not so long ago; during the years leading up to, and the year of our 2015 general election I, among many others realized I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the current state of affairs in our political landscape, and that there were changes that needed to be made. With this dissatisfaction as a recurring thought in my mind, I worked towards becoming properly informed and yet found it wanting. I knew that it wasn\u2019t enough to just be informed and that if I wanted to see real change, I would have to lead by example. So I began to volunteer with the Liberal Party of Canada. Through working with people that I truly and full-heartedly support and believe in, I found myself finally able to play that part in helping to work towards the positive changes I had hoped to see. One of my favourite parts about working in politics is seeing such things come together so well. No matter what you\u2019re trying to do; when you see that your work and that of others has come together harmoniously to achieve something great-it is an immensely proud moment.\" https://www.facebook.com/LPCO.PLCO/", "Today is #ThursdayTalks with LPC(O) and we'd like to introduce you to Colin Mahovlich!\"I\u2019ve always retained a passion for politics and firmly believe a healthy country requires a healthy amount of political participation from all members of society. Time and time again I\u2019m amazed at the dedication of many of the MP\u2019s I\u2019ve spoken too, being able to hear out their informed perspectives, and clearly seeing the drive to do what\u2019s right. The responsibility to hear peoples concerns and to find practical solutions aimed at getting results continues to drive me to participate in political life. I strongly believe it\u2019s important to fight the cynicism that many people slide into when they fail to see results from the actions of their leaders. The Liberal Party continues to lead Canada in a positive direction and focuses on delivering those tangible results on the issues I care about.\" https://www.facebook.com/LPCO.PLCO/", "Check out what Canadians from across the country are saying about the difference the Canada Child Benefit is making in their lives: https://www.facebook.com/LPCO.PLCO/", "Today is #ThursdayTalks with LPC(O) and today we'd like to introduce you to Haseeb Hassaan!\"I came to Canada from Sri Lanka at a young age, I am thankful to immigrate to a beautiful country that was diverse, open and accepting of people from different backgrounds.

In 2011 I was working a job which required a fair amount of research on world events and current issues. I found myself reading more and more about Canadian policies nationally and internationally and was quite disappointed with the things I was hearing. Policy decisions were happening that went against scientific evidence and that would clearly marginalise certain groups and supported specific ideologies. When I started investigating the different political parties, the Liberal party was the only one where I could find upcoming events such as pub nights and BBQs. I was able to start attending events without any pressure to join. I got to meet great people and found people with whom I shared many values and aspirations for how Canada could be so much better. Since then, it's been my great pleasure to work with my local Liberal riding association to engage our community members and grow the Liberal brand. I truly feel that with our party, I can have a real impact on decisions made about our country's future.\" https://www.facebook.com/LPCO.PLCO/", "Today is #ThursdayTalks with LPC(O) and we'd like to introduce you to Liam Turnbull\"I want to contribute to a movement that is inclusive to all Canadians.

What part of politics that interest you? What can you do as a student in politics?\" The answer is always simple. The political process is about making real and meaningful changes to the everyday lives of ordinary individuals. With hard work and dedication, together with fellow volunteers and friends at the Liberal Party, our generation can be the generation of change and influence government policies.

When kids get the best possible start in life, everyone wins \u2014 now and in the future. That\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to invest in new schools and child care spaces in communities throughout Ontario. Parents tell me they\u2019re struggling to find convenient, quality child care close to home.

It is by collectively condemning acts of violence and hatred such as this that we show who we really are in Ontario.We must stand firm in our support for this young girl and her community, and in speaking out against racism and intolerance in every form. Everyone in our province has the right to worship and dress however they choose. And everyone has the right to feel safe and respected no matter what they are wearing or where they go.If the reports we are hearing are accurate, this can only be seen as an attempt to make certain people feel unwelcome or unsafe in our province.

It\u2019s fantastic to see support for workers. People deserve a living wage for the hard work they do every day. The truth is, when people are paid fairly, everyone wins. A living wage leads to greater job satisfaction and productivity, less turnover and more spending power for workers. When workers have more money, businesses have more customers and hire more workers. There\u2019s no denying that that\u2019s good for everyone. I\u2019ll keep listening to businesses and taking actions to address their concerns about raising the minimum wage.

But I\u2019ve also been fighting for Ontario workers in other ways. As the official start of the NAFTA negotiations approached, I\u2019ve taken every opportunity to defend Ontario workers. I have met with dozens of mayors, governors, senators and other leaders from all levels of government across the U.S. I\u2019ve traveled to Washington, D.C. to talk about a renewed NAFTA as an opportunity to create fairness and growth on both sides of the border.  I\u2019m happy to hear that GM will be producing a new line of trucks in Oshawa. The is good news for the workers there. Oshawa has a strong history in auto production \u2014 they\u2019ve been part of the industry for over 100 years.

Simply put, it is the right thing to do for our workers, especially now that Ontario\u2019s growth is outperforming all G7 countries. I understand the pressure this change puts on some small business owners. But a growing number of them are saying that paying their staff a living wage is good for business. A father of six who runs a metal parts processing facility in Niagara and a millennial entrepreneur with a dog walking business may not have much in common, but they agree on this: the benefits of paying people a living wage outweigh the costs. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "I\u2019ve already heard from parents who say it\u2019s making a difference for them. Based on what parents are telling me, I know, for the millions of parents who were struggling to afford the medication their kids need, or simply couldn\u2019t afford to foot the bill out of pocket, OHIP+ is going to make a huge difference.

It was such a necessary expansion, not just for parents, but for youth and new graduates, too.  OHIP+ is a great start, but as Dr. Jessica Ross points out, it\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s past time for a national universal pharmacare plan. As we build a province that is fair and full of opportunity for everyone, I will absolutely continue to push the federal government to implement a universal pharmacare plan that benefits not just the people of Ontario, but all Canadians. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "You don\u2019t have to talk to many workers before it becomes clear that a minimum wage increase was long overdue. I\u2019ve made my stance on this clear \u2014 raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do for Ontario workers. And overwhelmingly I\u2019m hearing from workers that they also believe this is the right thing to do. We raised the minimum wage to $14 to create more fairness and opportunity in our province, but now unfortunately it appears that some employers are abandoning the spirit of this legislation and some may even be doing worse than that. The stories we've all heard over the past week have not only been disappointing, but quite frankly, they've made me and others in this province angry. Working people in Ontario deserve much better than that. I understand the pressure raising the minimum wage will put on some business owners, but as my colleague Kevin Flynn, the Minister of Labour, said this morning, the bullying behaviour we\u2019ve seen from some businesses will not be tolerated.To Ontario workers, I say this: We've got your backs. The vast majority of businesses in this province are decent organizations that understand that if they treat their employees well, they become more profitable, and they become more productive. Nobody working 40 hours a week should have to live in poverty. That simply isn't on in Ontario. We've made changes that will protect and support you and will make our workplaces fair for everyone. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Kids like Rayanna give me so much hope for the future. This 10-year-old I met at my Town Hall in Brampton has so many thoughtful ideas about how we can build a better province \u2014 and world \u2014 for everyone. And she\u2019s not shy about sharing them! I can\u2019t wait to see what she accomplishes. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "This was a big week for fairness in Ontario! On January 1st, changes came into effect to make Ontario a more fair and decent place to work. You\u2019ve probably heard that the minimum wage was raised to $14 an hour, but there were other changes, too: all workers now get 3 weeks\u2019 paid vacation after 5 years with the same employer, everyone gets personal emergency leave to handle life\u2019s ups and downs, and we\u2019ve increased parental leave, too. The changes don\u2019t stop here. The biggest one yet will take place next January 1, 2019, when the minimum wage gets another boost to $15. Until then, and after, I\u2019ll continue working to make Ontario a fairer, better province for everyone. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Mental illness should be treated like any other illness \u2014 and treated with the same fast access to care that we provide when someone gets sick. But unfortunately, those supports just aren\u2019t there yet \u2014 and they\u2019re especially needed for youth. Last year when I spoke with students on school campuses across Ontario, one of the topics that came up the most often was mental health. Students of all ages shared their mental health struggles with me. Young people today are so intelligent and capable, but they still need our support. That\u2019s why in 2017 Ontario invested in more psychotherapy, supportive housing, and mental health services for youth. With faster access to mental health and addictions services, thousands more young people can access the support they need, when they need it. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Aisha Abdunnur, a 21-year-old woman from Ottawa recently told Chatelaine the minimum wage increase \u201cwill change my life because, hopefully, I won\u2019t be constantly worried.\u201d For Aisha and her family, the increase is being able to afford \u201cbasic things\u201d. The time to increase the minimum wage is now. In 2017 Ontario added more than 175,000 jobs. Big businesses continue to celebrate record profits, while many people in this province still can\u2019t afford the basics.Ron Joyce Jr. \u2014 a man whose family founded the Tim Hortons chain, which was sold for billions of dollars \u2014 wrote a letter to his employees stating those who want to continue receiving dental and health benefits will have to pay a portion of the plan\u2019s costs.Workers at a Tim Hortons in Eastern Ontario have been asked to sign a pledge agreeing to work nine hours and be paid for eight and agreeing to lose their health benefits. I must admit, I was deeply upset to read these reports.I\u2019ll be blunt. It is the act of a bully.If Mr. Joyce wants to pick a fight, I urge him to pick it with me and not those working the pickup window and service counter of his stores.It\u2019s past time we put people ahead of profits. That\u2019s why I am so disheartened when I hear some of the wealthiest among us want to offset this much-needed raise on the backs of their employees.Tim Hortons is a Canadian institution. It\u2019s a ritual before Saturday morning hockey and a daily habit many of us enjoy. But I know I want the person who hands me a tea or coffee in the morning to be able to pay their bills, raise his or her kids and enjoy the full benefits of life in Ontario. Again, I think that\u2019s just fair \u2014 and I know many people across this province agree.Please see my Op-Ed in today\u2019s Toronto Star: https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2018/01/05/pick-a-fight-with-me-mr-joyce-not-those-working-the-pickup-window.html https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Increasing the minimum wage is for the families who work 40+ hour weeks but still need to go to the food bank to put food on the table for their kids; it\u2019s for the single parents who work multiple jobs to make ends meet; and it\u2019s for everyone working hard but still unable to get ahead.  It\u2019s going to change lives. And so, like many others I was upset to read reports about how Ron Joyce Jr \u2013 a man whose family founded the Tim Horton\u2019s chain which was sold for billions of dollars \u2013 is treating his employees and responding to the recent rise in the minimum wage. The many people who get up and put in a full day\u2019s work in this province deserve to be paid decently and, just as importantly, they deserve to be treated decently. Asking workers to sign a pledge agreeing to unpaid breaks or agreeing to less pay than actual hours worked is neither decent nor fair.I\u2019ll be blunt. It is the act of a bully. I\u2019ve always fought for those who are being treated unfairly and I\u2019m not about to stop now \u2013 so if Mr. Joyce wants to pick a fight, I urge him to pick it with me and not those working the pick-up window and service counter of his stores. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Ontario is growing faster than all G7 countries, which is fantastic news, but that growth means the cost of buying or renting a home has gone up, too.

We needed to take action to make renting or buying home in Ontario more affordable, and that\u2019s exactly what our plan is doing. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Raising the minimum wage to $14 an hour (which took effect on Monday!) is going to change lives and it puts fairness at the heart of Ontario\u2019s growing economy. For the third straight year, Ontario is outperforming all G7 countries in growth, and our unemployment rate is the lowest it\u2019s been in 17 years. BUT - and it\u2019s a big but - even with all this positive news there are still so many families who are getting left behind in our rapidly changing economy. The rich are getting richer. Something needs to be done to make sure ordinary families can get ahead. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking bold, decisive action to rebalance the scales. We\u2019ve just made the biggest increase to the minimum wage in Ontario history. Next year we\u2019re bringing more fairness by boosting the minimum wage even further to $15 on January 1, 2019. The Conservatives still want to stop that from happening. But I still know that raising the minimum wage to $14 then $15 an hour is the right thing to do. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Creig says OHIP+ means he won\u2019t have to worry about the cost of his son\u2019s prescription medication anymore.

The minimum wage is increasing to $14 at midnight! Our economy is changing, and more and more people are struggling to support themselves and their family on minimum-wage work. Increasing the minimum wage to $14 tomorrow, and $15 by January 1, 2019, will give more than a quarter of employees across the province a much-needed and much-deserved wage hike. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "In just a few days, we\u2019re launching the biggest expansion of health care in Ontario in a generation. 4,400 prescription drugs will become absolutely free for everyone 24 and under through OHIP+. This will make a huge difference for millions of kids and their families across the province. And it\u2019s just the beginning.I\u2019m committed to fighting for a universal pharmacare program for everyone in the province, and by making prescriptions free for everyone under 25, we\u2019ve taken a big step forward. There is no program like this anywhere in Canada. One day soon, I hope we can have a national pharmacare program from coast to coast to coast. With Ontario\u2019s leadership, that day could come soon. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "As Premier, some decisions are difficult to make. But sometimes, the need for action is crystal clear. Electricity is an essential part of our daily lives, and for too long, governments (mine included) had made mistakes in the way we structured Ontario\u2019s electricity system. The system became unreliable and it was poisoning our air. We fixed it, but it was a mistake to put all those costs on just today\u2019s generation of ratepayers. They should have been spread out over the life of the system. Cutting hydro rates by 25% earlier this year was the right thing to do. Ontario is a fairer place because of it. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Building a fairer, better Ontario is about creating the conditions where everyone has a chance to get ahead \u2014 and stay ahead. Because right now, the rich are getting richer but everyone else is barely able to keep up. And if you\u2019ve fallen on hard times, hard work alone is no guarantee you\u2019ll get back on your feet. You need a real chance. That\u2019s what the Basic Income pilot we launched this year is giving people in communities around the province \u2014 the support they need to take care of themselves, retrain or find a job, and get back on their feet. And if it works the way we hope, we\u2019ll look at scaling it up. We can\u2019t escape a changing global economy, but by changing the way we do things in Ontario, we absolutely can come through this period of upheaval into more opportunity, more security and more fairness. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "This one is making a big difference for hundreds of thousands of students and their families: we\u2019ve overhauled OSAP so that more students have the opportunity to go to college or university \u2014 regardless of their family\u2019s income \u2014 and graduate with less debt. To compete and succeed in our global economy, we need our graduates to be at their best. With fewer expenses in school, less debt when they graduate, and less anxiety about financial support along the way, students of all ages will be better prepared to start their new career and climb the ladder to home ownership, or starting a family, or whatever their dreams and ambitions in life. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "New Year\u2019s is a time of reflection and change, so as we count down to 2018, I\u2019m reflecting on all the change in our economy in 2017 and looking ahead, to the changes that we are making to build a province where no matter what happens in the global economy, families are able to get ahead. First on our list? Our commitment to help 100,000 more kids access quality child care.

So it really concerns me when I speak to parents who are weighed down with the extra stress of not being able to find affordable, licensed child care. Even though they\u2019re ready to go back to work, and need the income to support their families, some parents have to stay home or make huge sacrifices just to get their child the strong start they need. We have to do better. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to creating another 100,000 child care spaces in 5 years, so that families can access the high-quality care their kids need, and parents have the opportunity to go back to work. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "We\u2019ve all heard the stories of families who had to make the impossible choice between putting food on their table or paying their hydro bill. I\u2019ve spoken to some of these families. I know it was not fair to them or to anyone. Especially this time of year, people shouldn't have to choose between keeping the lights on and putting food on the table. Ending coal, rebuilding the crumbling electricity system and cleaning our air were all the right things to do. Smog days are thankfully a thing of the past. But putting all the costs on today\u2019s ratepayers wasn\u2019t fair. The system we\u2019ve built will benefit Ontario for generations to come. That\u2019s why, starting in the summer, we cut hydro bills for everyone in Ontario by 25%, and we\u2019re providing further relief for low-income families and those in rural areas. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "High speed rail in countries around the world has proven that it cuts down on travel times, creates jobs and supports communities along the way. Not only that, but Ontario is growing, and we need to continue to build up transportation across the province to keep up with that growth. That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to a full Environmental Assessment to build high speed rail along the Toronto-Windsor corridor.  As we move forward with the project, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the opportunity that high speed rail creates from Toronto to Windsor and in the innovative communities everywhere in between. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Some people have a particularly difficult time during the holidays. It\u2019s heartbreaking to think of families who can\u2019t afford to celebrate with their loved ones the way they\u2019d like to. But the holidays are also a time for hope, because we know it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We know we can build a fairer, better Ontario for every family. And that\u2019s why we launched  at a Basic Income pilot in 2017.Ontario\u2019s economy is strong but that\u2019s not necessarily translating into better or more opportunities. So this is the perfect time to take bold actions that change our province for the better. Our Basic Income pilot will help people who have fallen on hard times get back on their feet. It will allow them to go back to school, search for a job, pay for their basic necessities, and get the support they need. And then we\u2019ll know if a basic income is a smarter, more successful way of supporting people who are in transition.We don\u2019t have final results yet, but so far it\u2019s clear that this change is helping people access opportunity and fairness that we all deserve. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Commuters tell me that they\u2019re sick of being stuck in traffic every day. They need their trip to work every day to be reliable and affordable. At a time when our province is growing and people are travelling further from home to go to work every day, I get that.

I believe that access to post-secondary education should be based completely on your potential, and not at all based on your ability to pay tuition. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve overhauled the Ontario Student Assistance Program. The new OSAP gives more students the chance to go to college or university \u2014 over 210,000 are receiving free tuition this school year for the first time ever, and for so many others grants are more generous than before. I have a plan to build a fairer, better Ontario and in a big way, it rests on every young person getting that chance to go to college or university, without graduating under a mountain of debt.

The action plan for seniors that we introduced this year focuses on the issues and areas that seniors have told me matter to them the most at this stage in their lives \u2014 like living independently for as long as they can, and staying active and connected to their community. We\u2019re empowering seniors to make their own choices when it comes to their care, their independence, and how they access the government services they need.

As the way we get around changes, more and more people are hopping on their bikes to get where they need to go. It\u2019s great, and we need to support it.

This year, finding affordable housing became a serious concern for families all over Ontario. We listened, and we took action. Our plan has calmed the frenzy in the housing market and it\u2019s increasing the supply of new homes to keep things calm. And because skyrocketing rent increases weren\u2019t at all fair, we introduced rent control on all rental units throughout Ontario \u2014 no matter when a building was built.When you have an affordable roof over your head, the world is a different place.

One of the most challenging things about our changing economy is the uncertainty it\u2019s created for families. Benefits plans aren\u2019t what they used to be, and parents can\u2019t always afford insurance to get the support their families need. When circumstances change so drastically like this, I believe government has a responsibility to step up and provide some of the security that has slipped away. That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching OHIP+ on January 1st, 2018. Free prescription medication for everyone under 25 will help families get their kids the care that they need, at no cost.

It was a special day \u2014 she made me wear white gloves for the occasion. I think there's something special about the possibilities new transit brings, and I got that same feeling at our announcement today. The six new stops that will open this weekend will get people to work, class and home to their families all the way from Vaughan to Toronto. Years in the making, Ontario contributed $974 million to the project. The opening of the Toronto York-Spadina subway extension means York University students can finally take the subway to class for the first time, and elementary school students can now take the subway on field trips to Pioneer Village. And not only that, as our province continues to grow, it will connect cities and regions through a fast, reliable and affordable new transit option.  This momentous day marks a huge milestone for transit in Ontario, but our investments won\u2019t stop here. We\u2019re keeping our shovels in the ground and look forward to celebrating many more big transit projects \u2014 from LRTs in Waterloo, Toronto and Ottawa, to Regional Express Rail along the Toronto-Windsor corridor \u2014 that will help people connect throughout Ontario. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "This year has been about creating fairness and opportunity, so as we approach Christmas I want to highlight 12 things we\u2019re doing to make Ontario more fair and to give families opportunity. First up, a huge, necessary change that is going to make a difference in millions of lives starting on January 1st . We\u2019re increasing the minimum wage to $14 on New Year\u2019s Day and to $15 on January 1st, 2019, because it is the right thing to do.  If you work full-time, you should be able to buy the groceries you need, pay your rent and support your family. But the reality is that I hear from people who not only work full-time, but juggle multiple jobs, and they still struggle to make ends meet. Some families, after a 40+ hour work week, have to rely on food banks to feed their kids.  On January 1, these families are going to wake up in a fairer, better Ontario. And making sure millions of people get the raise they deserve is just one way that Ontario is changing for the better on January 1st. Stay tuned for more! https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Parents tell me that they're anxious about the future. When they look at today's economy, it looks different than it did when they were entering the job market. Students need to be prepared for the jobs that will be available to them in a rapidly changing, global economy. To help students prepare, we need to make sure that our courses, programs and skills training keep up. That's why we're adding financial and digital literacy to the Grade 10 career studies course next September. We're also expanding hands-on learning opportunities in the course to give students tangible experience. These changes will better equip students with the life skills they need to succeed. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "The stress of finding affordable child care is driving parents to the brink. Raising your kids should be a wonderful, joyful experience, so when parents tell me about the difficult, stressful choices they\u2019re making because they can\u2019t find quality, affordable child care, I know something must be done. No parent should have to give up their career simply because of a lack of child care, and yet this is happening, especially to women. We\u2019re never going to reach gender equality and close the pay gap if mothers are unable to work. None of this is okay.That\u2019s why, this morning, we announced new child care spaces at nearly 200 schools throughout the province \u2014 so that 8,400 more kids can get the best start possible, and parents can return to work when they\u2019re ready.  That may sound like a drop in the bucket, but it\u2019s part of a plan to help 100,000 more 0-4 year-olds access child care over the next five years \u2013 and we\u2019re well on our way. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Attending college or university should be about how much effort you put into your studies, not how much education you can afford. When you're a student, the fees add up fast \u2014 it might be the heftiest bill to pay, but tuition is just one of the costs you need to cover. That's why, in addition to free tuition for 210,000 students this fall through the new OSAP, we've taken action to make other parts of your education more affordable, too \u2014 including textbooks. We've made online textbooks free for students, so that you can focus on your studies. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "The way people get around is changing \u2014 there are more cyclists on the roads than ever before.

Their young lives were taken in a place they loved, and a place they belonged \u2014 the classroom \u2014 just because they were women. 28 years later, I wish I could say that all women are treated with kindness and respect. But the chilling truth is that women are still at a greater risk of violence of harassment, and it happens in their homes, at work, and in public. This gender-based violence has touched all of our lives, and we need only look to the ever-growing claims of sexual harassment and violence in the news recently to see just how prevalent and heartbreaking it is.  And so, in memory of the 14 students at L\u2019\u00c9cole Polytechnique, and every other victim of gender-based violence, today we recommit ourselves to ending violence against women and supporting all women who experience it. In Ontario we\u2019re making progress \u2014 taking concrete steps like making it easier for women experiencing violence to break their lease and find free legal advice \u2014 but we need to do more, and quickly. We can\u2019t stop until we\u2019ve built a province and a society where everyone is safe and respected. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "I want to hear from you! Last month I held a Town Hall where anyone could come and ask me anything. People showed up with fantastic, sometimes tough questions about the issues that affect them and their community. It was a great conversation. I\u2019ll be holding another Town Hall next week \u2014 this time in Peel Region.     Like last time, no topic will be off the table. It\u2019s important to me that I hear from the people of Ontario directly. That\u2019s part of what government and my role as Premier are all about. In this economy of uncertainty and rapid change, we\u2019re working to build an Ontario where everyone can get ahead. It\u2019s unacceptable to me that the rich keep getting richer while others are being left behind.  So, I want to know what\u2019s on your mind? What\u2019s holding your family or your community back? I want to hear your ideas so that we can create opportunity and security for everyone. http://ontario.ca/townhall https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 visit to Ontario hospitals busted key myths about our single-payer system. As Senator Sanders discovered \u2013 our health care system is world-class when it comes to innovation and excellent care. And our highly skilled healthcare professionals prove it every day when they put patients first, making sure you get the care you need \u2014 without worrying about the cost.

We gathered in solemn remembrance at the Sai Wan War Cemetery, as people have done for the past 70 years, to honour the soldiers who bravely fought to defend Hong Kong during WWII. The ceremony was an opportunity to give thanks for the unimaginable sacrifice our soldiers made. It was in Hong Kong that Canadian soldiers first entered battle in the Second World War, and 550 Canadian soldiers died here, in battle or captivity. On this very meaningful day, we honoured those who are no longer with us, our veterans, and those who continue to serve today. As we remember the lives lost to war and the sacrifices made by an entire generation, this important site is a reminder to always choose peace and diplomacy over bloodshed and war. We can\u2019t repay those buried here for everything that their sacrifice has given us, but we can vow to uphold the values of democracy and the freedom that they fought so hard to defend. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "It's powerful to see so many women coming together and using their collective voices to speak out against sexual violence. It takes courage to say #metoo and to push for the shift in attitudes and behaviours that is needed to make our society safer and more equal for all women.

To help families prepare for this exciting change, we\u2019ve created a new, mobile-friendly online search tool to check if the medication your child needs will be covered. It helps you quickly and easily search the list of more than 4,400 publicly funded medications and other drug products. Visit this page to try it out: https://www.ontario.ca/ohipplus The list includes asthma inhalers, drugs to treat depression, anxiety, epilepsy, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, antibiotics, EpiPens, diabetes test strips, oral contraceptives, medications to treat some childhood cancers and other rare conditions, and thousands of others. In this time of rapid economic change and uncertainty, our government is doing everything we can to make sure that families have the support they need to take care of their kids.

That means there are 180,000 more jobs in Ontario today than there were last year at this time. It\u2019s great news, but I know it isn\u2019t good enough. I know there are still so many who see these numbers and ask how it is possible that in a growing economy like this, they\u2019re still falling behind.  In your Facebook comments, in your tweets, and when I meet you in your community, I hear about the real challenges you\u2019re facing in our changing economy. The trouble finding affordable child care. The struggle to save for retirement. The growing commute. The shrinking sense of security. It all adds up to the reality that growth just isn\u2019t doing what it used to. We need to find new ways of making sure that growth benefits everyone, and that\u2019s exactly what our plan for a fairer, better Ontario is about. Raising the minimum wage, providing free tuition and free prescriptions for children and youth, creating 100,000 child care spots\u2026 these are the steps we\u2019re taking to build an economy where everyone has a fair shot at getting ahead. An economy where growth isn\u2019t just a number in the news, but is something that means more opportunity and more security for you and your family.  Today\u2019s job numbers tell us that we\u2019re on the right track, and we absolutely need to keep going. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "This week someone asked a question on my Facebook page about supports for students in Ontario, who have good grades but don't have the money to go to college or university. I was happy to be able to respond that we've taken major steps to make pursuing a post-secondary education more affordable. In fact, this fall 210,000 Ontario students received free tuition, and more received grants that will help them graduate with less debt.I believe attending college or university should be about a student's potential, not what they or their parents can afford.

He says the extra $750 a month he receives as part of our basic income pilot has eased the stress and mental illness that kept him out of work since 2002. Tim Button, another Hamilton participant, shared a similar sentiment. \"It's making a huge difference for me,\" he told the Associated Press. Adding that an almost 60% increase in benefits through the pilot has helped decrease his depression, allowed him to schedule a long-postponed trip to the dentist, eat healthier & make plans to visit distant family over the holidays for the first time in years. I know that in our uncertain economy, people are falling behind, and that means as a government, we have to do everything we can to give people more opportunity to get ahead and to make our province fairer. Our basic income pilot is making a positive difference.

I know seniors, especially those on a fixed income, face real challenges with increasing costs. I'm taking action to make life more affordable for seniors and all renters across Ontario. We all need a safe, affordable place to call home. I've heard from seniors who had to scramble to find a new place to live when their rent suddenly skyrocketed and was impossible for them to afford. That's not fair, it's not right, and it's time for government to step up and do something about it. Everyone deserves assurance that a sudden, dramatic change in rent isn't going to leave them without a roof over their heads.

But that\u2019s not all Bill 148 will do to make sure Ontario workers are treated fairly.It\u2019s a fact of life that sometimes emergencies will crop up when we least expect them. And when they do, everyone should be able to get the time off they need to support their family. Under the old rules, some workers didn\u2019t have that freedom. And that wasn't fair. We passed a law to make sure that all workers have at least two days of paid emergency leave a year. This law will also raise the minimum wage to $15/hour on January 1, 2019, make sure that part-time workers are getting paid equally for doing the same work as their full-time colleagues, increase vacation time, ensure reliable scheduling and regulate being on call.

We're also working to keep your costs down. For people transferring between GO transit and the TTC, transfer fees are about to be cut by 50%. If you make that transfer every day, those savings are going to add up to about $720 a year. Our communities are growing because people want to live and work here.

I\u2019m kicking off the mission in Beijing, where one of the highlights of my first day was a fireside chat on women and leadership.

Over the next two weeks, I\u2019ll meet with business and political leaders to strengthen Ontario\u2019s already strong trade and innovation partnerships and identify new opportunities for collaboration.

We are guaranteeing a fair, living wage for everyone who works hard in Ontario, and requiring employers to give workers the fair scheduling, emergency leave, equal pay for part-time workers, and paid vacation we all deserve. I've met people who work full-time or juggle multiple part-time jobs at the minimum wage, and it's just not enough to support themselves and their family. That is never fair, especially in an economy where the rich are getting richer. In this time of uncertainty for so many, I have a responsibility to take action.

Our world is changing so quickly, and as we tackle some of the greatest challenges of our time \u2014 like climate change \u2014 it\u2019s undeniable that science needs to play an increasingly important role.

Today we introduced legislation that would end the college labour dispute and return students at Ontario's 24 colleges to the classroom as soon as possible.We've also instructed colleges to establish a dedicated fund with all savings from the strike.

It was so important to me to hear from this young woman. Against impossible odds, she did everything right and still couldn't afford to stay in school. And she told me about people she knows who are working two minimum wage jobs and still can't pay the bills.  But she hasn't lost hope. She is getting the support she needs to go back to school next year and go after her dreams. When I think about some of the things that we're doing as a government, I think about people like her - people who just can't get ahead and are on the edge of losing hope. It is frightening to think that there entire communities who are not getting a fair deal in our economy, places where hope is fading. That's really scary. And it's wrong. The things I'm doing as Premier are about building an economy where everyone can feel hopeful about the future, because they know they can get the education they need, because there are good opportunities out there, because a minimum wage job pays a decent wage, a fair wage, enough to get by. In an economy where the rich are getting richer, it is just wrong to me that there are millions of hard-working people falling behind. They deserve a raise. On January 1st, that's what they'll get. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Yesterday, Charles Sousa released Ontario\u2019s Fall Economic Statement, or FES. FES is a mid-year check-in on our finances, how our economy is doing, and how we\u2019re doing on the commitments we made to you in the 2017 spring Budget. Since we tabled this year\u2019s Budget, I\u2019ve spent time in communities throughout the province. One thing people tell me no matter where I am, both in person and online, is that they\u2019re having a hard time today, and feeling even more uncertain about the future. The rising cost of living is a real challenge. But government can help \u2014 that\u2019s what government exists to do. And with our balanced Budget, we\u2019re not missing this opportunity to build greater fairness across the province. We are strengthening the key public services that matter most and doing things that will make everyday life fairer and more affordable. I\u2019ve talked about some of the things we\u2019re doing quite often here on my Facebook page. Things like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by January 1, 2019, and launching OHIP+ on January 1, 2018, which will provide free prescription drug coverage to everyone under 25 \u2014 all you need is a health card. We transformed OSAP to help students of all ages pursue their dreams. With our changes, 210,000+ students received free tuition this fall for the first time ever, and many more saw an increase in grants and were able to take on less debt. Applications are now open for students to apply for support for the 2018-2019 school year. Something you might not have heard as much about is what we\u2019re doing to support seniors. I know that\u2019s something I think about a lot \u2014 my parents are 89 and 91. Last week we announced that we\u2019re creating more than 30,000 new long-term care beds over the next decade, and providing more supports so seniors can live independent, active and socially connected lives. For those on the other end of the spectrum, who are just starting out in their careers, we\u2019re taking action so that they can get their foot in the door and get ahead in our quickly changing economy. We\u2019re encouraging skills development and training through programs like the Graduated Apprenticeship Grant for Employers, and we\u2019re providing new incentives to small businesses that hire young workers. From working parents, I\u2019ve heard that it can be difficult to find quality, affordable child care. As part of our commitment to provide 100,000 new spaces, we\u2019ve helped 24,000 more children access licensed child care this year. Waitlists aren\u2019t gone yet, but they\u2019re getting shorter and we\u2019re going to keep going. So, what does FES really have to do with you? Well, if you feel like things are not as fair as they used to be, like the rules have changed under your feet, or you\u2019re just fed up with the constant struggle to keep your head above water, FES is reassurance that your government is listening and taking action. We have a comprehensive plan to create fairness and opportunity during these turbulent times.

And people like William Bacon, who goes by Bubba. Bubba was just 24 years old when his unit was one of the first to land on Juno Beach for that fateful D-Day invasion, which eventually lead to the liberation of Europe. I am grateful for the opportunity to say thank you, and to share their stories with everyone who came to Queen\u2019s Park for our annual Ceremony of Remembrance.The sacrifices that our fallen soldiers, veterans and their families have made are more immense than most of us will ever know. But we must try. Because every one of their stories is a powerful reminder that we must do all we can to resolve conflict with diplomacy and peacemaking, not bloodshed and anguish. We owe everything to our veterans and all they ask is that we never, ever forget the sacrifice of their fallen brothers and sisters. We must never take for granted that our freedom was won by the horrors they faced in war \u2014 the sacrifice of so many young lives \u2014 the shattering of so many families.

They tell me that seniors want the freedom to make decisions about their care, independence, and how they access services. And I know exactly what they're talking about - my parents want the same things!Some retirement communities spring up naturally, as seniors move into an area or an already bustling neighbourhood ages on its own. These seniors don\u2019t want to move into a retirement home \u2014 and they should have choices. If you\u2019re happy where you are, we should support you where you are. That just makes sense.As part of our new plan for seniors we\u2019re investing more than $15 million over two years in apartment buildings or housing developments where many seniors already live close to one another. These aren't retirement homes, but with a few key services and supports they could work way better for the seniors who live there.

Cobalt, Ontario hopes so. An anticipated surge in demand for cobalt is breathing new life into the town. On a search for new sources of the metal \u2014 a component in batteries used to power electric cars \u2014 automakers like Tesla found just what they were looking for in this Ontario town of only 1,100.It\u2019s no secret that our economy is changing. One of the biggest challenges is that growth and opportunities are increasingly gravitating to the Ottawa and Toronto areas. As we work to make sure every part of the province can benefit from Ontario\u2019s growth, it\u2019s encouraging to see a huge opportunity like this for a northeastern town.

In just 2 months, you\u2019ll see the biggest expansion of medicare in a generation.  Starting January 1st, 2018, your child\u2019s health card is all you will need to fill their prescription medications for free anywhere in Ontario. No copay, no strings \u2014 100% free prescription drugs for everyone in Ontario up until their 25th birthday.As our economy changes, I have heard from families who have lost their benefits or never had any to begin with. I have heard from young people who are struggling to get their career started after graduating. And I have said all along that we can and must do more to support people and save them money, especially in these uncertain times.Our health care system isn\u2019t perfect, but it is getting better every day. And OHIP+ is a huge step forward. The next step is to keep working with my fellow premiers to get a universal pharmacare program that covers adults as well, because I believe everyone in Ontario should be able to access the medicines they need to stay healthy. And I know we will get there.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/upshot/bernie-sanders-went-to-canada-and-learned-a-few-things.html https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "When everybody can contribute their voice to our democracy, we can build a fairer, better Ontario.

The Fraser Institute backs that experience up with numbers, too - according to the report they released this week, Ontario's recovery from the recession has been extremely uneven, and most of the new jobs we've seen since 2008 have been in Toronto and Ottawa. That's why I'm taking action. Increasing the minimum wage will make this growth fairer so everyone across the province can benefit. We're also expanding emergency leave to a minimum a two paid days, and making sure that employees who work for the same company for 5 years get at least 3 weeks' vacation. When we all get the opportunity to be a part of Ontario's growth, everyone benefits. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Part-time and temporary workers deserve to be treated fairly. I've traveled all over the province over this year to sit down with workers and hear their experiences. One thing I hear time and again is that part-time, temporary and contract workers are working just as hard as their full-time colleagues, but they are being paid less - even though they're doing the same job. That just isn't fair. I've heard you, and I'm taking action to change this. Our plan makes sure that ALL workers are treated fairly. We're making it illegal to pay part-time or contract workers less than full-time workers for doing the same work because everyone deserves a fair shot at getting ahead. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Join us for the launch of Common Ground, our grassroots policy consultation, featuring a keynote and live panel discussion on the economy. In the face of challenges like globalization, automation and climate change government must take an active role in ensuring fairness and opportunity for everyone.Premier Kathleen Wynne will engage in a live discussion with panelists and an online audience across Ontario about how to respond to the changes people are experiencing in our economy and society. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "This weekend at my nomination I met Basil, Maria, and A.J. in my community of Don Valley West. They all had thoughts to share about the change they want to see in their community - where free tuition is making their education more affordable, and programs are supporting children and residents. They want to live in a fair community and province. These are the diverse voices I'm representing - and the voices that push me forward in fighting for fairness. As our communities and our economy changes, I believe that everyone deserves to benefit from economic growth - and, in the highly skilled, globally competitive economy we're building, we need everyone to be a part of it. We've all seen what the changing global economy can mean \u2014 less security, reduced benefits, more part-time, minimum wage work and growing inequality. And we don\u2019t have to look very far to see how quickly the gains we\u2019ve won in the past to make our society fairer and kinder can be challenged, or even dismantled. Those things are happening as we speak. Those are real risks.That's why my plan meets these challenges head on. It increases the minimum wage to $14 an hour on January 1st and $15 one year later. It makes it illegal to pay part-time or contract workers less than full-time workers for doing the same work. And it gives everyone the right to vacation and paid sick days. In the public health care system, we\u2019re creating fairness for every family with OHIP+,  a universal pharmacare program for everyone under the age of 25. In education and child care, we\u2019ve delivered Full-Day Kindergarten and now we\u2019re creating 100,000 more child care spaces. It isn\u2019t fair that some families can find child care and others are left scrambling. We\u2019re fixing that.  And under our plan, college and university tuition is free for 210,000 students starting this school year. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "In Ontario and Canada we have health care that we can be proud of and over the weekend, I was proud to show our health care system to Senator Bernie Sanders. But there is more work to do to build an economy where everyone has a fair shot at supporting themselves and their families, things like making sure everyone is paid a fair wage.  Today I was listening to workers at The Irv Gastro Pub to hear from the people who will be affected by the changes we\u2019re making. There is a true family vibe in the restaurant \u2014 it was started in memory of owner Regan\u2019s father\u2014 and the respect that Regan and Jaclyn have for their employees in so clear. They\u2019ve been paying their employees fair wages for years, and they say the difference it makes in their workplace is huge. One of their staff members even says she loves her jobs several times a day!  I heard from the pub\u2019s staff that being paid a fair wage gives them the ability and flexibility to take care of themselves and work towards their goals. Alyssa is able to pursue her goal of becoming a firefighter while working at the pub, and Natasha is able to study to become a social worker. The staff couldn\u2019t imagine how anyone is able to support themselves and their families on the current minimum wage.  I\u2019m confident that raising it to $15 by January 1, 2019, is the right thing to do to build a fair economy for everyone. https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Senator Bernie Sanders Speaks to University of Toronto https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "Senator Bernie Sanders Speaks to University of Toronto https://www.facebook.com/WynneFans/", "The Conservatives don't have your best interests in mind.

That\u2019s why I am so disheartened when I hear some of the wealthiest among us want to offset this much-needed raise on the backs of their employees.Workers at a Tim Hortons in Eastern Ontario have been asked to sign a pledge agreeing to work nine hours and be paid for eight and agreeing to lose their health benefits all because the owner of their store says he can\u2019t afford the minimum wage increase. I must admit, I was deeply upset to read these reports.Because this demand is coming from Ron Joyce Jr. \u2014 a man whose family founded the Tim Hortons chain, which was sold for billions of dollars.Asking workers to sign a pledge agreeing to unpaid breaks or agreeing to less pay than actual hours worked is neither decent nor fair.I\u2019ll be blunt. It is the act of a bully.If Mr. Joyce wants to pick a fight, I urge him to pick it with me and not those working the pickup window and service counter of his stores.Tim Hortons is a Canadian institution. It\u2019s a ritual before Saturday morning hockey and a daily habit many of us enjoy. But I know I want the person who hands me a tea or coffee in the morning to be able to pay their bills, raise his or her kids and enjoy the full benefits of life in Ontario. Again, I think that\u2019s just fair \u2014 and I know many people across this province agree.Because at its core, the minimum wage debate is about what kind of society we want to live in. I look to the south, where middle class children lost health care coverage in the same bill that cut taxes for the richest of the rich, and I know it\u2019s the wrong path. That\u2019s not who we are as a province, and it\u2019s not who we are as a country.Raising the minimum wage is not a radical act. It\u2019s just fair.\u201dhttps://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2018/01/05/pick-a-fight-with-me-mr-joyce-not-those-working-the-pickup-window.html https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "The largest expansion in a generation of our universal health-care system started on New Year's Day, with free prescription drug coverage for children and youth under 25. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "It\u2019s an historic start to 2018 in Ontario! https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "Happy New Year! https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "The largest expansion of public health care in a generation\u2014starting tomorrow. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "This year, we reduced electricity rates on average by 25%. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "A basic income pilot is one way we\u2019re working to build a fairer society. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "Please watch and share Premier Kathleen Wynne speaking to Americans about our universal health-care system and our new OHIP+, which will ensure free prescription drug coverage for children and youth under 25 starting starting on January 1st\u2014in just a few days!https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1842129252485223/ https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "Free tuition is a game changer for 210,000 students. https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "Follow the Premier as she counts down to the New Year: https://www.facebook.com/OntarioLiberalParty/", "Merry Christmas!

As we look forward to time with family and friends, the conversation around the table might include some talk about the future of Ontario. The Premier spoke to her team this week \u2014 reflecting on 2017 and looking forward to 2018.   I thought I'd take a moment to share some of what she said. I found it very inspiring to be reminded about all the work that has been done for the people of Ontario and what great things are to come. We know many people still do not know of all these positive things so, if the conversation does turn to politics, I wanted to give you some highlights that you might want to pass along \u2014 as you are passing the potatoes. The Premier started by acknowledging that people do feel a sense of unease. From rapidly changing technology, to uncertainty about trade, to Trump \u2014 it can feel like the world is moving way too quickly. We are responding to this by listening to people across the province and creating real, positive change in their day-to-day lives \u2014 people across this province who work hard, and who are worried during this time of intense change in the world. In 2017 we balanced the budget and made great strides to make 2018 a year of real, positive change for the people of Ontario by: - Supporting over 1.5 million workers by increasing the minimum wage to $14 an hour \u2014 and ensuring another increase to $15 in 2019.- Helping millions of children and youth under 25 access over 4,400 free prescriptions \u2014 which is the first of its kind in the country.- Providing free postsecondary tuition to 210,000 students, so they can continue their education and unleash their potential.- Continuing to build transit, bridges and hospitals across the province as part of the largest infrastructure development plan in Ontario's history.Discussing the future of Ontario is important: the Conservatives recently announced their platform. Something they don't like talking about, but is clearly outlined in their campaign document, are over $12 billion in cuts to services like health care and education. The people of Ontario deserve better. In closing, thank you for all that you do to support our team, whether by speaking up for our values with family and friends, making a year-end donation, or knocking on doors on a Day of Action this year.

We are so fortunate to live here in Canada, a country that defends the freedom of all its citizens to practice their religion in safety and peace.

As a thoughtful and dedicated school board trustee and city councillor, she made it her life\u2019s work to create opportunity for those who are struggling, and spoke powerfully about her belief that tackling poverty in our communities is a responsibility we all share. She has left a lasting imprint on Toronto, and also on our party. She was an active New Democrat who will be remembered fondly and proudly by the NDP and our members.

Devenu chef de la CAQ en 2012, c\u2019est lui qui a convaincu Ga\u00e9tan Barrette de faire le saut en politique.Et Fran\u00e7ois Legault a remis \u00e7a r\u00e9cemment : le chef de la CAQ a propos\u00e9 qu\u2019on donne plus d\u2019argent aux m\u00e9decins pour les inciter \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer des t\u00e2ches aux infirmi\u00e8res.

Tous les fonctionnaires, employ\u00e9s et agents de l\u2019\u00c9tat doivent avoir le visage d\u00e9couvert dans le cadre de leurs fonctions. Cela doit aussi \u00eatre le cas pour les citoyens lorsqu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent des services de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Le tchador doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre interdit pour tous les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat.* Comme l\u2019a propos\u00e9 le rapport Bouchard-Taylor, nous estimons que les personnes qui ont un pouvoir de contrainte \u2013 juges, gardiens de prison et policiers \u2013 ne doivent en aucun cas afficher leurs convictions, y compris religieuses. Ce doit \u00eatre le cas, aussi, pour les autres figures d\u2019autorit\u00e9 que sont les enseignants du primaire et du secondaire, ainsi que les \u00e9ducatrices en garderie. L\u2019univers des garderies \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s diversifi\u00e9, un comit\u00e9 se penchera sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans les diverses formes que prennent les services de garde, notamment le milieu familial. Cette mesure s\u2019appliquera graduellement; les salari\u00e9s actuels pr\u00e9serveront leurs droits acquis.* Au cours de leur formation et dans le guide \u00e9thique qui sera remis chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque salari\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat, le gouvernement fera la promotion d\u2019un devoir de r\u00e9serve, affirmant sa nette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la plus grande r\u00e9serve possible dans l\u2019affichage des convictions, politiques, sociales, religieuses ou autres, des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9tat dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions, par respect pour la diversit\u00e9 des convictions des citoyens.* Une \u00e9quipe de parlementaires et d\u2019experts sera charg\u00e9e d\u2019examiner les exp\u00e9riences \u00e9trang\u00e8res en ce qui concerne le port du voile int\u00e9gral, le niqab et la burqa, et d\u00e9posera ses propositions au gouvernement.\"Le document pr\u00e9voit de plus l'abolition du cours \u00c9thique et culture religieuse et son remplacement par un cours de Citoyennet\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Il pr\u00e9voit finalement que la libert\u00e9 de conscience des \u00e9l\u00e8ves et leur droit absolu au savoir doivent primer. Le parcours p\u00e9dagogique ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 pour des consid\u00e9rations religieuses ou autres, que l\u2019\u00e9cole soit publique ou confessionnelle. De plus, l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e0 la maison ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour soustraire des classes enti\u00e8res d\u2019enfants \u00e0 leur acc\u00e8s au savoir et \u00e0 leur participation \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.On peut lire le texte int\u00e9gral ici: https://pq.org/nouvelles/identite-quebecoise-une-approche-resolue-equilibre/ https://www.facebook.com/jflisee/", "Paradis fiscaux: Le Parti lib\u00e9ral manque de courageAlors que des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations sur l\u2019\u00e9vasion fiscale de responsables lib\u00e9raux canadiens font les manchettes, Philippe Couillard tarde \u00e0 appliquer les recommandations du rapport de la commission des finances publiques sur les paradis fiscaux.

While the Government of Canada was unable to offer the Moss Park site for the full period requested for reasons outlined by MP Adam Vaughan, I am appreciative of the steps they have taken, and I am particularly grateful for the direct assistance of Ministers Harjit Sajjan and Ralph Goodale, both of whom I spoke to personally in recent days. As a result of the Request for Assistance and the subsequent intergovernmental discussions, the Province of Ontario has also indicated the availability of a nearby building that could be prepared as a Winter Respite site for the duration of the winter months, while the Armoury is used as a temporary measure. I look forward to working with City and provincial staff as well as Minister Peter Milczyn as more details regarding this option become available. This is another great example of all levels of government working together to address a serious and complex issue, and to keep our residents safe. I want to be clear that there remains space for all those who need it within the current winter respite system and that two additional warming centres have been opened during this extreme cold weather alert. Together, these measures constitute the largest City increase in shelter capacity during a winter season to meet unprecedented increases in demand. The request regarding Moss Park was made this week in anticipation of required additional capacity in the coming weeks.  City staff is already hard at work to begin providing shelter services at the Armoury site, and they continue to assess how we can best deliver shelter at all appropriate sites across Toronto during this extraordinary demand for shelter services. https://www.facebook.com/johntoryTO/", "The Bentway Skating Trail will officially open tomorrow!

Last night, our Streets to Homes outreach workers encountered 14 people on the street: 3 individuals accepted services and were transported to shelters or elsewhere, 11 people refused services. In December, council directed staff to add 400 additional spaces to the system through winter respite centres, existing shelters and hotel rooms. As of this morning, we are approximately half way through opening those 400 spaces. We are taking action to expand the capacity of the Better Living Centre. As of last night, the facility went from 110 to 140 beds. It will increase to 150 beds tonight. We have been in touch with armed forces personnel since December and based on City staff advice yesterday, we will now be requesting from the Government of Canada formal confirmation that the Moss Park Armoury can be made available as a 24-hour respite centre for up to 100 beds until April 15th.

These steps were in fact taken, most within days of the council approval, and the new shelter at the Better Living Centre has been open now for ten days. Our expert staff continue to believe the Better Living Centre is a better option for a winter respite than the armouries. The Better Living Centre can accommodate 110 people right now, it is open 24/7, and it is a city-owned site.  I continue to support our hard working shelter staff in deciding when and if extra capacity is required. City staff advise me that our shelter system continues to experience demand - shelter occupancy was at 95% last night which is consistent with other nights over the past month \u2013 but the system is coping with that demand. According to staff, there were around 60 spaces available at the Better Living Centre overnight and the women's respite on Cowan Ave., along with around 20 to 30 spaces at the Peter St. Streets to Homes Assessment and Referral Centre. Staff have been working throughout the day to clarify information about where people can find shelter in the city and to let people know that shelter is available. I've also been assured by staff that the City outreach team will visit the Moss Park overdose prevention site tonight before it closes to ensure anyone who needs shelter is able to access it. I appreciate the advocacy and outpouring of emotion from people who want to help Toronto's homeless population. I share the desire to make sure we are doing everything possible to help people who find themselves homeless in Toronto. I want to thank City shelter staff and everyone who works across the shelter system for the work they have done dealing with the unprecedented demand we have seen over the last year. Their work is saving lives and will continue to save lives. https://www.facebook.com/johntoryTO/", "2017 - the year diversity defined our strength https://t.co/KyFaevjhMW via @torontostar https://www.facebook.com/johntoryTO/", "It has been 15 years since the last time we opened a new subway station in Toronto but earlier this month, 6 new Toronto Transit Commission subways finally came online.

June Rowlands served the residents of our great city from 1976 to 1994 but her community involvement stretches back to the 1950\u2019s. She helped build this city and blazed a trail as the first woman to serve as a TTC commissioner, budget chief, executive committee member, chair of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Commission and Mayor. She was elected as Toronto\u2019s 60th Mayor in 1991 with a platform that focused on law and order, protecting the city\u2019s ravines and green spaces, supporting social housing, and preserving the history within our city\u2019s neighbourhoods. She was a strong representative of her North Toronto community and it is fitting that Davisville Park was renamed June Rowlands Park in 2004 to honour her work. Losing a loved one is never easy, especially at Christmas, and I again extend my condolences to June\u2019s family and friends at this time. They should know that her service to our city is tremendously appreciated and that she will be missed. https://www.facebook.com/johntoryTO/", "Toronto is moving as quickly as possible to address this unprecedented demand on our shelter system.

Starting today, we are opening up a portion of the Better Living Centre at Exhibition Place which will, once it is fully up and running, offer 100 of these spaces.

Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada has reduced the barriers for citizenship while others across the West are heading in the opposite direction. Our allies are strengthening citizenship rules to meet the new reality that our borders\u2014and, increasingly, our values\u2014are under siege. Australia is the latest country to address this issue, as centre-right Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced sweeping changes to his country\u2019s citizenship and immigration framework.Australia will reduce its immigration intake, cap the maximum age for skilled workers at 45, and bring in tough new English language requirements for all new residents.In order to be eligible for Australian citizenship, newcomers are now required to live in Australia for four years, pass an English language test as well as a civics test, or, what is being dubbed an \u201cAustralian values\u201d test.When it comes to defining Australian values, Turnbull said, frankly, \u201cwe\u2019re defined by a commitment to common values, political values, the rule of law, democracy, freedom, mutual respect, equality for men and women.\u201dImagine that. A country so sure of itself, it can restructure its immigration system and ask newcomers to pass a values-test without digressing into hysterics. In Canada, the very suggestion that Canadian values exist has led to endless pearl-clutching and mud-slinging from the elites. Just look at what happened to Kellie Leitch.

From day one, I have been working with the energy industry, workers and communities to support our energy industry, break the land-lock, and open up new markets for our products.Key to that work has been our Climate Leadership Plan, a plan developed in partnership with members of our oil and gas industry. It\u2019s a plan that\u2019s tailor-made for Alberta\u2019s economy, protecting jobs in our resource sectors, creating new jobs elsewhere and helping our province diversify.Central to that plan is the belief that combating climate change and building new pipelines aren\u2019t competing concerns, they can and must go hand-in-hand. Everywhere I go, Albertans tell me it's important to create jobs, diversify our economy, and protect our province from future oil price shocks. I couldn\u2019t agree more. And we\u2019re going to keep working to make sure the economic recovery reaches everyone. But there are new signs of hope, and those signs are building.

Holodomor refers to the famine-genocide of Ukrainians at the hands of Stalin\u2019s Soviet authorities.In 1932, all food was taken from Ukraine and its borders were sealed. The state-induced famine killed 10 million people in just two years. At the height of the genocide, the toll was 25,000 people a day. Then Ukraine\u2019s religious, artistic, intellectual and political leaders were arrested, deported or executed.Holodomor touches every Albertan of Ukrainian heritage in a deeply personal way. Eighty-five years later, the deliberate destruction of families, learning and culture continues to be felt with profound sadness and loss.Alberta understands. We stand by our friends, neighbours and families of Ukrainian heritage. And since 2008, the fourth Saturday in November is proclaimed as Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (Holodomor) Memorial Day in our province.Remembering the genocide of Holodomor is for all Albertans.

To my friends in the Conservative Party of Canada and their Alberta cousins: Canadians won\u2019t support energy policies based divisive political tactics. Denying climate change also won\u2019t get pipelines built. To the Liberal government: Step up.

As we\u2019ve recently seen, we know that the transgender community, here in Alberta and around the world, still faces harassment, discrimination, bullying and violence.No one should live in fear of violence or harassment. No one should be discriminated against, denied basic services or lose their life because of who they are. Today is a day to remember those that we\u2019ve lost, but also serves as a call to action and a reminder for us to look forward to how we will help those still in need.The Government of Alberta remains committed to protecting all genders and sexually diverse Albertans and will continue the fight for LGBTQ rights in our province, our country and the world.

Today, U.S. decision makers carefully considered a pipeline and granted an approval.We continue to urge Canadian decision makers to follow this example so we can have access to global markets from Canadian ports, supporting good Canadian jobs.

As someone who grew up in Fairview, I know that our small towns help make our province great. No matter the size, rural Alberta knows how to get things done, and I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m proud to have that as part of my background.Turns out, the skill that would come in handy most as Premier was the time I spent cleaning up after horses. The first time I got a good look at the books, all I could think was: I\u2019m going to need a bigger shovel. We had a choice to make: Cut our way out of the recession, or build our way out. Make a bad situation worse, and try to make up for lost oil revenue through cuts, or keep a steady hand and invest in Albertans. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to make sure our rural infrastructure is modern, safe and efficient; to make sure the great chain of commerce that runs from our rural soil to our urban office towers is as strong as can be. Our oil and gas resources can help fuel prosperity for Albertans and all Canadians for generations to come. Canada and the world will continue to need oil from responsible, sustainable places like right here in Alberta. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to continue to listen to people like the Mayor of Beaumont, not Burnaby. That\u2019s why we are working day and night to get pipelines built, in the smartest, safest, most efficient way possible. Almost every economic indicator that should be is up, signalling Alberta\u2019s economy is growing. But not every Albertan is feeling it and there\u2019s more work to do for the economic recovery reaches everyone. At the same time we are taking careful, compassionate measures to bring our deficit down. We need to do more so we can return to balance in a way that enhances rather than hinders the economic recovery underway. The same steady approach that saw us through the recession is going to see us carefully and compassionately tighten our belts, and ask others to tighten theirs. Practicality tells us to protect the priorities of everyday families while reducing spending elsewhere, which is what we will do. Albertans take care of one another. Together, we can make life better for all Albertans - from our biggest city, to our smallest hamlet \u2013 as we grow and diversify our economy, and make sure hardworking Albertans have good jobs. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "The big outdoor Christmas tree has arrived! \ud83c\udf84 Now it\u2019s time to start putting up the 155,000 lights around the Legislature and Federal Building Plaza. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "Every year, Canadians pause on the 11th hour of the 11th day of November to remember the sacrifices made by our men and women in military uniform.99 years after the end of the First World War, we continue to reflect on the courage of those who fought so proudly and bravely. We especially remember the thousands of Albertans who answered the call to serve.Remembrance Day is a time to reflect on those who laid down their lives or were wounded physically or emotionally.Their sacrifice has been repeated through the years, as the women and men in our Armed Forces have spent countless hours away from their loved ones to serve in conflict zones and help people cope with natural disasters and humanitarian crises.We can never repay them all, but we can, and do, remember. And we also pause to thank those who continue to serve this great province and our country. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "Today we came together in remembrance to honour the sacrifices made to protect our democratic way of life. 2017 has been a year of somber milestones marking sacrifices by Albertans and Canadians far from the peace and security of home. The 75th anniversary of the Dieppe Raid, the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, and the 100th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Passchendaele. We gathered to remember all those who served and sacrificed in the Great War and in almost a hundred years of war and peacekeeping duties since then. Today we may not fully comprehend the horrors faced by those young Canadians, but it is our duty to remember they faced those horrors for us. It is our duty to honour those who fought for the values we hold dear.It is our duty to affirm that their actions have had a real and lasting impact in our lives. The freedoms we enjoy were bravely defended, often at a very high personal cost.  The debt of thanks we owe to those defenders\u2014living and dead\u2014is expressed best through our actions like coming together in solemn remembrance at ceremonies like this and wearing a poppy with gratitude. The struggle for freedom, acceptance, equality and peace continues. Some of us fight for those values in legislatures and through advocacy, in the face of criticism.  That we can do so is a legacy of those who fought \u2014and continue to fight\u2014on battlefields and peacekeeping missions, in the face of assault.  We remember, honour and thank them for that. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "This evening, I was proud to stand in the Legislature and voice my support for Bill 24, for GSAs and most importantly, for LGBTQ students & their allies. This bill will protect the lives of some of our most vulnerable citizens. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "Today in the Legislature we honoured the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Corps taking Passchendaele, Belgium, and declared Nov. 10, 2017 Battle of Passchendaele Day in Alberta:  By October 1917, British, Australian and New Zealander troops had been fighting to seize the village of Passchendaele and its high ground for more than two months. They had made little progress at the cost of 100,000 casualties. In early October, Gen. Douglas Haig ordered the Canadian Corps, including four Alberta regiments, to relieve the ANZAC forces. After careful preparation, the Canadians took Passchendaele in just 14 days, and then held it against determined counterattack. They earned nine Victoria Crosses.One of those was Albertan Cecil John Kinross, who served with the 49th Infantry Battalion. With his company under intense enemy artillery and machine gun fire, alone he charged and destroyed the machine gun and killed its six-man crew, allowing his company to advance. He left the field severely wounded, but survived. Mount Kinross near Jasper is named for him.Kinross was one of almost 12,000 Canadians wounded at Passchendaele. More than 4,000 died there. They were among the 66,000 Canadians who gave their lives in the Great War, and among the more than 172,000 who were wounded.Every one of those soldiers went into battle with lives, loves and hopes for a future. They were sons and brothers, neighbours and friends \u2013 people from our own communities. They were heroes.Passchendaele has often been called Canada\u2019s second Vimy Ridge, because it solidified Canada\u2019s right to be seen as an equal among nations, and drew wide recognition of our valour and determination. In the century since, our armed forces fought other battles in other wars and other countries, and have been called upon to serve as peacekeepers. They have earned the recognition of the world, and we honour them at home with pride and with remembrance.Today, as we remember Passchendaele, we thank all who serve. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "\u202aOn Aboriginal Veterans Day, we honour the courage & sacrifice of Indigenous men and women and their selfless service to our country. https://www.facebook.com/rachelnotley/", "Thank you to the Alberta Fire Fighters Association for having me at their annual reception.

However, Burningham also says: \"Perhaps some restrictions on the practice \u2014 something short of a full ban \u2014 would be permissible. But such legislation would have to be carefully tailored in order to respect the Charter rights at play.\"  This speculation overlooks the fact that the ONLY compelling interests and rights at play are those of pregnant people (whose interests include those of their fetus). Further, there's no problem to fix; therefore no rationale for restricting abortion. https://www.facebook.com/AbortionRights/", "This is an excerpt from \"After Morgentaler: The Politics of Abortion in Canada\" a new book by Rachael Johnstone. The excerpt focuses on the history of abortion rights and politics in Ontario. https://www.facebook.com/AbortionRights/", "Students and faculty at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) have been victimized by the CCBR's offensive aborted fetus imagery. The Academic Faculty Association has filed a grievance against SAIT on behalf of an instructor exposed to the graphic images.

Whose rights take precedence?\" But the two groups at stake in the abortion issue are not \"women and children\". It's human rights activists vs. anti-human rights activists. It's those for equality vs. those for oppression. It's pro-freedom vs. pro-punishment. It's feminism vs. misogyny. The article is making a false equivalency. Further, maybe the past decades of anti-choice lies, violence, hatred, and fanaticism, coupled with recent gains in women's rights, has made our side justifiably less willing to dialogue with them? https://www.facebook.com/AbortionRights/", "That's it?

Further, when the group flushed out 3 anti-choice candidates in the Sask. Party leadership race, none of them said they would introduce legislation around the issue if elected leader.

I\u2019m looking forward to writing the next chapter. https://www.facebook.com/honjohnbaird/", "My last speech to Parliament:Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying how overwhelmingly optimistic I am about the future of this country, optimistic because over the past nine years, I have seen the stature of our country grow in the eyes of the world. The world has seen and come to know and to count on Canada\u2019s strength, strength created by sustained economic growth and by our enduring values. Strength through our commitment to freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Simply put, the world has seen, in fact the world continues to see, the best that Canada has to offer.When I joined my good friend Mike Harris back in 1995, I was perhaps just a little naive, driven by ideology, defined by partisanship, at the age of 25. I quickly learned, though, that to make a difference, to really make a difference, you cannot be defined by partisanship, nor by ideology. You need instead, to be defined by your values. I believed then, and I continue to believe, that government has to be there for people. And that through hard work, it can be a force for good.When each of us chooses to enter public life, we do so united in one simple desire. The desire to leave behind a better country, a better province, and a better community. To pass on to the next generation a better place than the one we inherited from those who came before us.And now today, after serving 10 years in provincial politics, 10 years here in federal politics, in 10 ministerial portfolios, and with more grey hairs than I choose to admit, I can step back and say that we have an Ottawa that is vibrant and strong. A province whose future is bright and hopeful, with strong health care and an innovative and resilient workforce. A country that is the best in the world. We have led the G7 in job creation, and we have been a beacon of dependable light in a world that is roiled by far too many dark and stormy seas.Today Canada stands tall in the world. United with our allies and partners in the fight against terror. Side by side with the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. Strong relationships in the Arab world. Firm in our objection to militaristic expansionism in Eastern Europe. An expanded diplomatic footprint in Asia. And strong trade ties that will create lasting prosperity for generations to come. Canada stands tall in the world.Mr Speaker, last night I spoke to the Prime Minister and informed him that I was standing down from Cabinet. I expressed my intention not to run in the next general election in the new riding of Nepean. And I also expressed my intention to stand down as Member of Parliament for Ottawa West\u2014Nepean in the weeks ahead.I will miss this place very much, and many of the people in it, on all sides. But the time has come for me to start a new chapter in my life. If the House will indulge me, I would like to extend my profound gratitude and admiration to a few individuals who really made a difference for me.To my family \u2013 thank you for always being at and on my side. It is never easy to see one\u2019s son, grandson, brother, or uncle under the public\u2019s microscope. Not only have you been my strength during the difficult times, you have kept me grounded during the good ones.Through you Mr Speaker, to the Prime Minister. In 2005 when I was a younger, somewhat thinner provincial MPP, when many others counted him out I believed in this Prime Minister and I continue to believe in him today all these years later. There is no better person to lead our country into its 150th year. He is one of our country\u2019s great leaders. I leave, genuinely humbled to have enjoyed his confidence and truly honoured to have served with him; profoundly grateful to have sat in his Cabinet all these years and immensely proud of what we have been able to accomplish together for all Canadians. I am also distinctly privileged to count him as a friend and a mentor. I wish him and our party continued success for many years to come, and I look forward to campaigning for him and my colleagues in our party in the upcoming general election.To all of my friends in this place: for a Canadian there is nothing more meaningful and nothing more special than to sit in the benches of this sacred House and to serve with all of you. I am grateful to you for you friendship, for your counsel and for your wisdom. John Diefenbaker once said, that \u201cParliament is more than a procedure, it is the custodian of the nation\u2019s freedom\u201d. There is no greater honour for a Canadian than to serve in this place; no greater honour to serve the people who place their trust in us.For my staff, past and present: It is said that behind any successful minister are great staff and that is truly the case for me. I want to thank all of the staff and security in the House of Commons for their continued service to our democratic traditions. For the public service in all the portfolios I have served in and for our diplomats abroad. I leave with the feeling that my political career has been one of success in delivering real results for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. I thank all of you, from the bottom of my heart, for standing by my side and for your valued contributions to our country.Finally and most importantly, to the people of Ottawa West\u2014Nepean, the people of Nepean and the people of Ottawa: thank you.I am grateful for your continued trust, your vision, your community. Your support over these past 20 years means more than I ever can say in words. Being foreign minister was a tremendous experience, but I never took your trust for granted. I never forgot about our city. Every day I was reminded that it was you who put your trust in me and gave me this incredible opportunity.I was always committed to our people and its future, and I am so grateful for the volunteers in countless campaigns and riding associations; anyone who believed in me, in our party, in our government and, most importantly, in our message. Thank you.I stand before the House with many emotions. I am optimistic about Canada\u2019s future as a country. I am optimistic about my future and the opportunities that lie before me. At the same time, I am very saddened to leave this place behind. I am saddened to leave behind those for whom I care so deeply. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve my country, proud of the legacy of our government and honoured to have had the opportunity to stand in this place.May the true North stay strong and free, and may God bless Canada. Thank you. https://www.facebook.com/honjohnbaird/", "After twenty years of public office, I'm optimistic about Canada's future, and about the next chapter in my life. https://www.facebook.com/honjohnbaird/", "I am eternally grateful for the trust and opportunity that the people of Ottawa West-Nepean placed in me as their representative for the past ten years.

There is no greater calling than public service to your country, and I am proud of what our Government has accomplished over the past nine years.  I strongly believe that Prime Minister Harper is the best leader to move this country forward. Since 2006, he has a proven record as a strong economic manager, and a powerful voice of moral clarity on the world stage.

We saw Russia rip up international law and use a military invasion to annex part of a sovereign nation. We saw ISIL and all its gruesome brutality spread like a cancer through Iraq and Syria. And we saw Hamas terrorists try to instill fear in the Israeli people by deliberately targeting civilians with thousands of rockets and mortar shells through the air and with tunnels of terror underground.Canada has always approached global challenges from a principled position. We believe that the Kremlin\u2019s expansionism flies in the face of decades of international order and must be confronted. This is why Canada has answered Ukrainians\u2019 calls for help in maintaining their freedom and democracy and why Canada has led efforts to isolate Russia economically and politically. We believe that ISIL's actions against innocent civilians in Iraq and Syria, including members of religious and ethnic minorities, are barbaric. ISIL's expansion is a threat to international peace and security, and to Canada and Canadians. This is why Canada has joined the international coalition fighting against ISIL in Iraq, it is why we have worked to protect religious minorities and it is why we have delivered much-needed humanitarian assistance to those fleeing the violence in Iraq and Syria. And we believe that there is no moral equivalence between liberal democracies and terrorist groups, which is why we have strongly supported Israel\u2019s right to defend itself by itself.But while the world may seem more tumultuous than ever, there have been rays of hope and progress from all corners. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canada is saving the lives of millions of mothers and children across the globe with the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Initiative.

In an era of unprecedented global wealth and opportunity, there is simply no better place to live.While it may be tempting to congratulate ourselves for this blessed state of affairs, our gratitude should instead go to those who came before us and built so much of what we have. It starts with acknowledging the leadership and wisdom of Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and their colleagues. Coming together in a time of great danger, they constructed a system that would allow British, French, Aboriginal and Immigrant to unite, while preserving their unique institutions, languages, cultures and faiths. That achievement is, despite the youthfulness of our country, one of the most enduring models of democratic governance in the world today.Generations of men and women have since added their own stories to the annals of our history. Through wise decisions, hard work and sacrifice, they built our economy, developed our society and enhanced our liberty. Consecrating those triumphs are the tens of thousands of Canadians who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in distant lands, fighting to ensure that the great evils of the past 150 years did not come to our shores.A full appreciation of all we have been given should also lead us to embrace our own responsibilities to those who follow. Are we also ready to take the hard decisions rather than the easy paths? Are we prepared to dedicate ourselves to great causes in the face of grave challenges? Are we willing to make sacrifices in our own time so that our descendants will continue to enjoy our freedoms in theirs?If our answers to these questions are yes, and our actions bear out those convictions, then we can be assured that, in another 150 years, Canada will be even stronger and better than it is today.God bless Canada,Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper22nd Prime Minister of Canada https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Laureen and I wish to extend our sincere congratulations and deep gratitude to the Honourable Rona Ambrose as she announces her decision to leave public life.  Rona is a dear friend, an outstanding public servant, and a proud Conservative.  Her remarkable career spanned 13 years in Parliament, during which time she was elected on five separate occasions,  held five senior cabinet portfolios, and served as the Interim Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, and Leader of Her Majesty\u2019s Loyal Opposition in Parliament. As Prime Minister, I had the privilege of appointing Rona to some of the most complex and challenging cabinet portfolios in Government. Between 2006 and 2015 Rona served as Minister of Environment, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Labour, Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Minister for Status of Women and Minister of Health. Rona\u2019s contributions to our government, both publicly and privately, were many.  Yet despite a heavy workload, Rona always retained her warm and charming manner and down to earth Alberta humour. Rona\u2019s highly capable leadership of the Conservative team has set a high bar for those who will follow.  Yet her commitment to defending our values reaches well beyond her Parliamentary career.  Rona has been a passionate and articulate advocate for the rights of women and girls. As Minister for the Status of Women, Rona sponsored a resolution at the United Nations recognizing October 11 as International Day of the Girl. This effort to enhance awareness of gender equality, equal access to education, health care, and protection from violence for all girls around the globe stands as a lasting testament to Rona\u2019s efforts.

From 2010 to 2015 he served in the Prime Minister's Office as my Regional Affairs Advisor for his native British Columbia, and the three Territories. Shaun was blessed with intellectual curiosity, an encyclopedic memory, and an impressive capacity for bringing facts and original insight to bear on complicated issues.  As a result, he became a sought-after resource for colleagues throughout the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, myself included, and made a direct contribution to a wide range of policy files.  In recent months I have continued to lean on Shaun\u2019s invaluable expertise and deeply rooted understanding of Western and Northern Canada in his capacity as an Associate at my firm Harper & Associates.

Jim\u2019s life was an inspirational story of achievement and sacrifice. A man born of modest means who worked in coal mines to fund his way through university, his success in business and law was a testament to his personal tenacity, while his turn to elected office was a tribute to his sense of public service. In cabinet, his patience and perseverance in tackling some of Ottawa\u2019s most challenging portfolios was rivalled only by the depth of knowledge and insight he brought to his assignments - qualities he took to his tenure as premier of Alberta.I will never forget Jim\u2019s graciousness in 2002, when he, then the Progressive Conservative nominee in Calgary-Southwest, sacrificed his own candidacy to assist my return to Parliament. This was a reflection of his dedication to the conservative cause and to conservative unity, of which he would become a champion at both levels of government.A career in politics can be gruelling and it can be thankless. Many believe they can overcome or escape these challenges, but few openly embrace them, comforted by the knowledge that their purpose is something greater than themselves.

Rona Ambrose in Jerusalem today. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Laureen and I were saddened today to learn of the passing of President Shimon Peres, a towering figure in the history of the State of Israel and one of the great statesmen of our age.Shimon Peres\u2019 long and distinguished political career was animated by a tireless spirit of patriotism, faith, and public service. His was a life of sacrifice not only for his country and its citizens, but the very idea of Israel \u2014 the dream of a safe and prosperous Jewish state able to live in confident peace with its neighbours. Defeat and setback never deterred him, and his quiet humility and perseverance made him a model of dignity and an inspiration to the world. As a man who served his government in so many different capacities over so many decades, he demonstrated it was indeed possible to transcend the myopic world of politics in the pursuit of permanent ideals.I was honoured to meet Shimon Peres several times during the course of my own public life, and was consistently moved by his depth of knowledge and strength of character. It seemed remarkably appropriate that he was asked to spend his final years holding Israel\u2019s highest office, a position perfectly suited for a man who had come to so thoroughly embody the spirit, values, and virtues of the remarkable nation to which he devoted his life. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Laureen et moi avons \u00e9t\u00e9 attrist\u00e9s d'apprendre aujourd'hui le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du pr\u00e9sident Shimon Peres, un monument de l'histoire de l'\u00c9tat d'Isra\u00ebl et un des grands hommes d'\u00c9tat de notre \u00e9poque. La longue et distingu\u00e9e carri\u00e8re politique de Shimon Peres \u00e9tait anim\u00e9e d'un esprit patriotique, de foi et de service public. Il s'est sacrifi\u00e9 non seulement pour son pays et ses citoyens, mais \u00e9galement pour l'id\u00e9e m\u00eame d'Isra\u00ebl - le r\u00eave d'un \u00c9tat juif s\u00e9curitaire, prosp\u00e8re et en paix avec ses voisins. La d\u00e9faite et les reculs ne l'ont jamais arr\u00eat\u00e9 et sa pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance a fait de lui un mod\u00e8le de dignit\u00e9 et d'inspiration pour le monde. En servant son gouvernement dans diff\u00e9rents r\u00f4les au cours des derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies, il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il est possible de transcender le monde politique et l'atteinte d'id\u00e9aux permanents. J'ai eu l'honneur de rencontrer M. Peres \u00e0 plusieurs occasions au cours de ma carri\u00e8re publique et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par la profondeur de ses connaissances et sa force de caract\u00e8re. Il me semble appropri\u00e9 qu'il ait servi comme pr\u00e9sident lors de ses derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, une position faite sur mesure pour un homme qui incarnait l'esprit, les valeurs et les vertus d'une nation remarquable \u00e0 laquelle il a consacr\u00e9 sa vie. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Je suis tr\u00e8s heureux d\u2019annoncer aujourd\u2019hui que mon cabinet, Harper & Associates, a conclu une affiliation strat\u00e9gique avec Dentons, le plus grand cabinet d\u2019avocats au monde.

Aujourd\u2019hui, je souhaite vous informer que je d\u00e9missionne \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9put\u00e9 de Calgary Heritage.

Nous avons plac\u00e9 les droits des victimes avant ceux des criminels. Et notre pr\u00e9occupation pour les familles \u00e9tait au c\u0153ur de nos politiques. Nous avons su g\u00e9rer notre \u00e9conomie alors qu\u2019elle traversait la pire r\u00e9cession mondiale depuis la Grande D\u00e9pression et en sommes ressortis plus forts que jamais. Nous avons adopt\u00e9 des positions de principe dans un monde complexe et dangereux. Et, que ce soit au Canada ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, nous \u00e9tions toujours fiers de d\u00e9fendre notre pays. Chers amis, nous avons beaucoup accompli ensemble.

J\u2019aimerais exprimer ma reconnaissance \u00e9ternelle aux \u00e9lecteurs de Calgary Heritage, aux membres du Parti conservateur et \u00e0 tous les Canadiens et Canadiennes pour m\u2019avoir donn\u00e9l\u2019honneur de servir le meilleur pays au monde.

For a total of nearly eighteen years, I have had the tremendous honour of representing Calgary in the Parliament of Canada.  On seven occasions, I have been deeply humbled by your trust and support, time and again. And I leave elected office proud of what our team accomplished together.We united all Conservatives behind our agenda. We cut taxes, made critical investments and balanced the national budget. We got tough on crime and put families first.  We managed our G7 economy through the worst global recession since the Great Depression, and came out in the strongest position of them all. We took principled decisions in a complex and dangerous world. And, whether at home or abroad, we were always proud to stand up for Canada.  Friends, we did a lot together, but I know the best is yet to come.Our country must continue to serve as a model of prosperity and freedom. Pursue the principles we have stood for at home and abroad, and our children, and children\u2019s children, will inherit the Canada we know and love so dearly. As I bid farewell to the Parliament of Canada, and prepare for the next chapter of my life, my eternal thanks to the constituents of Calgary Heritage, to the members of the Conservative Party, and to all Canadians for having given me the honour of serving the best country in the world.May God bless all of you and may God bless Canada. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Il y a vingt-cinq ans aujourd\u2019hui, le Parlement ukrainien a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son ind\u00e9pendance de l\u2019Union sovi\u00e9tique.  Les Canadiens peuvent \u00eatre fiers que nous ayons \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier pays occidental \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre la souverainet\u00e9 de l\u2019Ukraine et, en cet anniversaire historique, je souhaite mes meilleurs v\u0153ux \u00e0 la population de l\u2019Ukraine et \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 ukrainienne du Canada.Malheureusement, les c\u00e9l\u00e9brations d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance de l\u2019Ukraine ont lieu \u00e0 un moment de d\u00e9fis sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour la souverainet\u00e9 et l\u2019avenir de l\u2019Ukraine. L\u2019occupation ill\u00e9gale par la Russie de la Crim\u00e9e et de certaines parties de l\u2019Ukraine orientale se poursuit et le r\u00e9gime Poutine brandit la menace d\u2019une escalade \u00e0 une fr\u00e9quence alarmante.La population ukrainienne fait preuve d\u2019une force et d\u2019une d\u00e9termination remarquables depuis le quart de si\u00e8cle o\u00f9 elle a choisi l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance pour son avenir.  Les Ukrainiens font aussi des sacrifices d\u00e9chirants pour d\u00e9fendre leur libert\u00e9, des innocents civils tu\u00e9s sur le Ma\u00efdan aux hommes et femmes en uniforme qui, sur leur propre territoire, continuent \u00e0 perdre la vie pratiquement tous les jours en raison de l\u2019agression militaire russe continue.Bien que le temps passe, le monde ne doit pas fermer les yeux sur les agissements du r\u00e9gime Poutine.  Maintenant plus que jamais, nous devons r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que cela prenne cinq mois ou cinquante ans, nous n\u2019allons jamais reconna\u00eetre l\u2019occupation ill\u00e9gale par la Russie de la Crim\u00e9e et de toute autre partie de l\u2019Ukraine.Alors que nous soulignons aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019important anniversaire de l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance de l\u2019Ukraine, nous devons rester aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la population ukrainienne alors qu\u2019elle se bat pour son avenir. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Twenty-five years ago today, the Parliament of Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union.  Canadians are rightly proud that ours was the first Western country to recognize Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and on this historic anniversary I extend my greetings and best wishes to the people of Ukraine and the Ukrainian-Canadian community.  Unfortunately, today\u2019s celebration of Ukraine\u2019s independence occurs at a time of unprecedented challenges to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and future.  The illegal Russian occupation of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine continues and the Putin regime threatens further escalation with alarming frequency.   The Ukrainian people have shown remarkable strength and determined resolve in the quarter century since they chose independence as their future.  Ukrainians have also made heart-wrenching sacrifices in defence of their freedom, from the innocent civilians murdered in the Maidan to those Ukrainian men and women in uniform who, on their own soil, continue to lose their lives on a near-daily basis as the result of ongoing Russian military aggression. Though time may pass, the world must not turn a blind eye to the actions of the Putin regime.  Now more than ever we must recommit that whether it takes five months or fifty years we will never recognize the illegal Russian occupation of Crimea or any other part of Ukraine.  As we mark today\u2019s important anniversary of Ukraine\u2019s independence we must continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they struggle for their future. https://www.facebook.com/RtHonStephenHarper/", "Laureen et moi offrons nos condol\u00e9ances aux proches de Gordie Howe.

(sounds funny to say but you will know what we mean when you slide one) Both the basement and the attic are unfinished but provide a ton of additional space down the road. The attic is especially cool with its rustic wooden flooring and large windows. \ud83d\udcf7 \ud83d\udcf7 The #photos HAVE to be seen, and you should probably look right now.

Activity level: low to moderate - true \u201cactive chill\u201d kind of girl. Loves to walk/adventure for hours but will nap/chill at home. Vetting: vaccinated (core vaccines); 4dx bloodwork negative for heartworm & three tick borne diseases (Ehrlichia/Anaplasma and Lyme); Wellness blood test (normal); CBC (Complete Blood Count) relatively normal (neutrophils slightly elevated due to dental issues which should be resolved post dental surgery); fecal (negative), dewormed; flea/tick prevention given, spayed, microchipped. Surgical history - growth removal (4 removed and sent out for histopathology; benign) and lump on chest is a suspected to be a lipoma. Dental Health Procedure performed (clean and polish) with 11 teeth extracted. Housebroken: yes!Good with dogs: incredible! Good with cats: not tested. Prey drive: none. Good with children: amazing kid dog! Even loves toddlers! Separation anxiety: whines and howls when left alone for the first 20-30 minutes. Lucy is loud so apartment/condos not recommended. Crate trained: not needed.Resource guarding: ZERO! Barky/noisy: very vocal. She likes to talk, will whine initially in new environments and when she is excited lets out happy howls and yodels (especially when she is playing with puppies). All of her vocalizations are adorable- not annoying and are very much a part of her dynamic and darling personality. Leash etiquette: pulls initially due to excitement and then settles into walk wonderfully! Leash reactivity: none. Transportation: whines in the car, not tested on public transit.*Lucy\u2019s bio may change as we get to know her better.*Comes with 6 weeks of pet insurance - $500 coverage. #WeloveLucy. Like LOVE her. There is no love greater than the love we have for this older but exquisite girl. She is absolute perfection. Lucy was surrendered just before Christmas to CCR as her owner passed away. Lucy was LOVED by her late dad (Godspeed\u2764\ufe0f) and the love just continued with her foster family. This girl has never experienced any kind of abuse and has zero triggers that could cause alarm. She would be great in a home with toddlers, or kids of any age. The only negatives we have encountered are: Lucy is literally obsessed with food. Obsessed. Lucy she has zero resource guarding and will allow toddlers to take her food away without issue. She loves food so much she may counter surf occasionally (yet not successfully due to her short and stout legs). Lucy will howl when left alone but stops soon after and shows zero destructive tendencies. Oh! And she is a bit (well a lot) overweight however she has begun losing a few pounds in her current foster home (7.8 lbs in 2 weeks!) and will continue to do so with her awesome weight loss program which is easy to follow. Instead of joining GoodLife just adopt Lucy and follow her diet program this January- #Lucydiet. Even though Lucy is a bigger girl weighing in at 28 kg she follows her foster mama around like a small dog..... in fact she IS a small dog in a big dog body. Lucy\u2019s most fav thing to do is go on walks. And HOT DOG she can walk! The minute that leash comes out of hiding she is so excited!  Good luck getting a leash on her for her exuberance is inspiring and she will howl, jump and prance all over the place which will commence the first part of her (and your) workout #catchthecutebitchifyoucan! Lucy will initially pull once out and about but quickly calms and walks perfectly beside her human. Lucy loves rubs and cuddles - and will occasionally give kisses. That lovely soft belly will beckon you to rub it and that sweet nose will demand adoration! Affectionate people need only apply. Lucy is the gentlest soul.....she loves everyone - adult, kid, toddler, dog and even evil squawking nippy Cockatoo. Her most fav kinda thing though......are PUPPIES! If you let her play with a puppy....any puppy that little bum won\u2019t stop shaking while her tail wags a mile a minute as she jumps for joy letting out little yodels of happiness (yes...Lucy is very vocal) #puppyobsessedporkchop\ud83d\ude1c.At night, Lucy will sleep next to you in a comfy doggie bed but prefers to sleep in bed next to you if she can fit #Californiakingcomfortneeded. She won\u2019t have any accidents so not to worry while you enjoy your beauty sleep. Lucy does snore so don\u2019t apply if you require absolute silence and if she is not permitted to sleep next to her human she will howl all night long (full moon or not). So if you think that you can love this porky but delicious darling more than we do please apply at adopt@covetedcanines.org OR apply directly through covetedcanines.org/application https://www.facebook.com/covetedcanines/", "Happy one year Gotcha Day anniversary to Motley and his family!

Never fear, Maya is here! She is not your average lap dog! All she wanted for Christmas was to come to Canada from Mexico to find her forever home, and we HAD to oblige. She's reactive on leash, so applicants should be prepared to seek some training support and learn techniques to work with her on that. However, her foster mom reports that this isn't a big worry for her! She's good with dogs when introduced properly and so she would make a great second (or third) dog! She LOVES her people, so if you're retired or work from home, Maya is INTO IT.FYI, Maya fully intends to claim her spot next to you in bed, so if you're not into midnight puppy cuddles, she's not your girl. Her Foster mama says her personality changes everyday as she becomes more comfortable, so if you want to see this beauty of a girl come out of her shell to be the dog she was born to be, step right up and send us an email: Adopt@covetedcanines.org OR apply directly through www.covetedcanines.org.

This little bean can be easily intimidated at first, but holds her own when playing with dogs bigger that her (which, let's face it, is most dogs). She also presents as timid to strangers, but if you give her your lap, she'll give you her love! Busy streets can make her nervous, but with some positive reinforcement (ALL the treats), she'd do just fine.She's crate trained, but you won't need it, she's not destructive in the least!

This sweet flower is so happy in her home \ud83c\udf37\u201cAs our first snow storm here and Tulip is experiencing her first snow, I thought I would send you an update!  Tulip is such a wonderful dog.  She has brought so much to our lives that we can\u2019t imagine life without her.  She truly loves love!  Both Jennabee and Tulip enjoy each other\u2019s company and play and sleep together.  There are no issues of conflict or aggression.  Though Jennabee has taught Tulip to bark at other dogs on walks which is very annoying!  Tulip and I went to puppy training at Pet Smart in the fall and she was so smart and caught on so quickly that we stopped going as I was bored.  She \u201clooks\u201d at me, \u201cwaits\u201d, \u201ccomes\u201d and \u201csits\u201d all on command.  She is a scavenger, will find food out on walks and won\u2019t let it go and gobbles it up.  She has grown a beautiful thick coat and willingly goes for grooming.   She is still such a cuddler and we love it.  I think John loves it the most and she knows it.  If we don\u2019t give her a rub she will hit us in the face for attention!  My guess is she is about 14 pounds now, a little chubby but she goes for long walks and is now enjoying running free at Rosedale golf course.

She is so lucky to get such a beautiful family to call her own.\u201cMy husband and I picked Poppy up Friday evening from the best foster mom ever, Kristy! We returned to London and planned on taking things very slow over the weekend. Poppy was so incredibly shy and skittish that I kept her double leashed on walks in my yard and single leashed in the house, just in case she made a dash for the door. It quickly became a nuisance indoors as the cats would chase her loose leash! Poppy was casually welcomed by Sophie, Scooter and Teddy. She definitely was taking cues from the dogs. Poppy spent her first night in her closed crate, her preference. She ate sparingly and did all her business outside, reluctantly releasing what she'd held for 24 hours! After that though, she seemed to really open up! We purposely kept things quiet again last night and she chose to join Sophie, Teddy and me on the loveseat to watch the hockey game.Today has been incredible so far! I so wish you were here this morning to see the shenanigans! Poppy slept in our room last night but she didn't want to go in her crate so I figured I'd just roll up the rug, remove the shoes on the floor and hope for the best. She eventually slept in her crate for the night but with the door open. No accidents and a peaceful night. She woke up when the cats scratched at the door at 7:30 demanding breakfast. She is like a different dog this morning! Sooooo happy to see me, wagging her tail! We went directly out for our leashed yard walk and she immediately peed and pooped! We came in for a nice breakfast. I went back up to my room to get her pink dog bed and Poppy, Sophie and Teddy all followed. Sophie and Teddy started playing on my bed and Poppy was interested. She allowed me to pick her up and put her on the bed too. Well, it was an invitation to Nirvana! This girl loves the king size Tempurpedic! Ha! She rolled and rubbed herself all over it and then up to me enjoying booty rubs! Then she engaged in the best appropriate play with Sophie and Teddy! I wished I'd had been able to video  it for you but my iPad was downstairs and I didn't want to interrupt the games. It was so wonderful and confirms that we've all done the right thing! So great I'm almost moved to tears! Well, no almost....I'm full on crying now. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udf40Afterwards, we went out for another yard walk and if she hadn't been on her leash I'm sure she would have been running and romping with the gang. I ran with her and for the first time, in her mind, I was running with her, not chasing her! I know we could have set backs along the road but I'm so encouraged! I think so much of it has to do with her observance of the gang and knowing that I'm safe, a source of food, love and comfort. Pretty amazing. I'm proud of my gang for being so welcoming.. I thought they'd be ok but I wasn't expecting exceptional. My cats have been right in there too. Old man Scooter gets tired just watching the activity! Poppy, Ted and Sophie are so well suited to each other. As you can tell, we are all feeling really great this morning!I really feel that so much of this success is due to the amazing care Poppy received from Kristy. Everything Kristy did was well thought out and measured to ensure a good transition for Poppy. She had the additional task of weaning the pups and dealing with Momma dog hormones! Kristy took Poppy to work to additionally socialize her and expose her to new situations. Kristy brought Poppy to London for a visit so that moving here wouldn't be her first exposure to my house, pets, people and yard. Also, Kristy's own dogs assisted in an amazing supportive way to show Poppy the business of being a well adjusted dog in Canada!We all feel beyond blessed to have Poppy and so many new friends through Coveted Canines. We can't even begin to express our heartfelt appreciation for all that every single one of you have done to assist in this adoption. Every person involved has played a critical roll in the success of this adoption, matter how how brief the interaction or involvement. Please share our sentiments with everyone as I'm sure there are many I haven't had any communication with. It truly does take a village!I'll send pictures as soon as I have some good ones.

Kristin's description of him was 100% bang on.  His very relaxed during the day, but when the kids get home from school he can sure mix it up with the best of them!  Although he doesn't mind going in his crate during the day, and even chooses to hang out there some times, he did have a very hard first 2 nights.  Last night was much better, I waited for him to fall asleep and then he only woke up once during the night.  He loves his food, his treats and his new toys.  Was a big day for him today.  We went on our first actual walk (so far we've been hanging out in the backyard as he was too nervous to go very far) and we couldn't go more than two steps without someone stopping to give him some love.  He also met my sister's dog today, and our sweet little puppy actually turned into a bit of a bully LOL so we'll have to get him some doggie play dates pretty quick to learn who to play nice.

Congratulations to Wally who gets a clean bill of health and his own fantastic family \u263a\ufe0f\u201cAfter medical fostering Wally for 5 months, we are thrilled to adopt this silly boy into our family! Medical fostering was challenging but extremely rewarding as we watched Wally grow healthier and stronger. After 5 long months of routine consisting of regular bathing, different medications and frequent vet visits, Wally finally received his health clearance. Everyone at coveted canines and DAH has been nothing short of amazing - we were so glad to have rescued our first family pup.

Now Spanky will be dividing his time between his apartment in the Beaches and his log cabin in the country near Kingston. The first night Spanky kept close to Tammy and Alan.  He slept at the end of the bed with them, but couldn\u2019t help wiggling closer and closer, giving lots of licks until he nuzzled his way right onto the pillow between them.  That\u2019s how he earned an affectionate nickname, \u201cthe Weasel\u201d because he not only acts like one, but sometimes even resembles one, too! Nobody got much sleep the first night and around sunrise the next morning, Spanky started exploring his new neighbourhood by walking the short block from his new home to the boardwalk by the beach.  He sat on a bench and marvelled at all the dogs and people who were walking and running past him. He was just upset he wasn\u2019t allowed to meet his liveliest new neighbours, the squirrels! Spanky soon met other new neighbours around his home.  Everyone he greeted, without exception, couldn\u2019t help remarking on how cute and adorable he was.  Then a day after he moved in, Spanky found a new toy that had been left on his doorknob.  There was no note or card because it had been given to him by another dog named Freddy, a neighbour and fellow graduate of Coveted Canines who lives with his guardians, Ashton and Angie.  The little white stuffed lamb is now his favourite toy and he prances around with it in his mouth all day long and takes it to bed every night. But Spanky\u2019s days haven\u2019t been all play and no work.  He\u2019s had a couple of sessions with Dan, from Golden Rule Training, and with his help, Alan and Tammy have taught Spanky to come when called, sit, and walk with a loose leash. (Well, sort of, more work needed on that one.)   Although, only 11 and a half months old, Spanky is considering a career as a therapy dog.  His gentle, loving, playful personality makes him a natural. Foster mum Cynthia suggested the possibility and Spanky has already taken steps in that direction by accompanying Alan to his office. Spanky greets the people who come to counselling with great enthusiasm, and with his jumps, licks and wriggles, they feel better even before they enter the room. Indeed Spanky is proof of the old adage that \u201cthere is no psychiatrist in the world like a puppy licking your face\u201d and he goes about his job with gusto.  People sometimes want Spanky to sit in their lap, which he does agreeably and when he looks up into their eyes with his soulful gaze, it truly seems to help their troubles melt away. Spanky is having new experiences every day.  When Tammy took him to the beach and right down to the edge of Lake Ontario, Spanky looked completely mystified and somewhat astounded.  He\u2019d never seen such a big bowl of water! When he was in his foster home, Spanky made friends with Cynthia\u2019s other dogs, Milou, Lucy and Asta.  Alan and Tammy have wondered whether he missed playing with his old friends. Fortunately, a doggie daycare centre called No Bones About It, is just a few doors down from where Spanky lives and he\u2019s had a chance to spend a few minutes there meeting and greeting the other dogs.  Next week he\u2019ll spend a little more time with them until it\u2019s clear he\u2019s comfortable visiting every so often. As you know, Spanky had an operation on his leg a few weeks ago.  For a few days after he moved in with Tammy and Alan, he was favouring his foot a little on his walks, but now you can barely tell one leg from the other!  He is even able to support his whole body on his sore leg when he lifts his leg to pee. He\u2019s had another checkup with his vet who is very happy with the way Spanky\u2019s leg is healing. He has encouraged Tammy and Alan to let Spanky run up and down stairs all he wants. While waiting for the vet, Spanky met another dog named Freddy (formerly Mario) who also came to Canada courtesy of Coveted Canines. Next week, Spanky will ride in the car out to the country to spend a few days exploring the land around the cabin. He\u2019ll walk the country dirt roads on-leash, sniffing for deer, fox, quail, bunnies and other wild, mysterious inhabitants! Spanky is so sweet, loveable and playful, he hasn\u2019t had much trouble at all settling into his new home and daily routine.  He may have had a tough start to his young life, but he hardly ever shows it.  As for Alan and Tammy, they are thrilled beyond measure to have a rare and special pup like Spanky in their life, especially after losing their beloved old dog, Shiloh, within the last year.  We\u2019d like to express our deepest gratitude to Carly and Cynthia and every single person who helped rescue Spanky and gave him a hand along the way.  We are especially thankful to all those who contributed to his operation and we want you to know that because of you, this lovely little dog is now healthy and free to go about his happy way. https://www.facebook.com/covetedcanines/", "The only thing this Bandit is stealing is hearts! Congratulations to him and his funny family \ud83d\ude02\u201cThis is Kirk, Bandit's dad.  Other names for him are getting tossed around; Leif (Lief Ericcson, a real explorer), DK (short for Drama King; he is a full body howler in a closed crate), Ragnar (he took the crate one time like a warrior).  Bandit is still sticking.He's doing really well.  There is so much stuff around our neighbourhood, so much stuff in our home to explore that his 2 sec attention span tank keeps getting filled. He has a radar for attacking things he shouldn't so we need to keep an eye on him and put ALL precious and dangerous things out of reach.  You guys are right to insist on conforming to a strict puppy proofing.  It's a good guage for ownership preparedness.  It proves to be a small effort compared to taking care of a puppy and if you can't do it, maybe a puppy is not the best thing 4 u.It's been a while since we raised a puppy.  I was younger then.  Coming to terms with how old I have become is sobering. Bandit is an energizer bunny.  His battery is small but strong and recharges fast.  Play, train, play play play, try to eat furniture, turn your back for a second and how did you find that?, rest, eat, drink, pee, poop, go after dirt, leaves, pebbles....repeat.  You don't need a gym to take care of him.He is very active, very clever, very smart.  Explores everything and watches you.  He might steal the car in his teens.  He does very well with commands. Sit, lie down. Heals very well considering his age.  He behaves like a working dog, probably a guard dog, so I think we will focus his training to satisfy that. Waiting for his shot so we can freely take him to the park.  Puppy training starts after necessary shot and examination.Thanks for Bandit. Thanks for the opportunity to care for a 4 legged baby.  Very challenging but extremely rewarding.  Thanks to all you and crew have done for the puppies. If one is a handful I cannot imagine how a whole pack was.  Off to tug of war with Bandit.\u201d https://www.facebook.com/covetedcanines/", "Congratulations to Bear on finding his forever den \u201cWe love our new addition to the family so much \u2764\ufe0f\u201d https://www.facebook.com/covetedcanines/", "Join us for a night full of laughter to benefit CCR and all the pups that need rescuing! https://www.facebook.com/covetedcanines/", "Congratulations to Eppi/Frank on his adoption!
