In 1984, activists nationwide gathered in St. Paul to write a share statement of belief that would become the basis of the Green Party. That statement put forth the importance of the rights of LGBT persons and their families \u2014 including equal rights in marriage and adoption. This followed the lead of the original German Green Party \u2014 and followed by other Greens globally \u2014 in seeing that relation between Social Justice and Ecological Wisdom. Our first national platform in 2000 recognized LGBT equality, and the first Global Greens platform in 2001 acknowledged the rights on LGBTI persons.  Green candidates have brought these values to the campaign trail. In 1998, Bern Haggerty ran for city council in Laramie, Wyoming. He was the only general election candidate pushing for the adoption of a bias crime law \u2014 ultimately adopted a few years later. Third parties hold the two-party political status quo accountable on their reactive ideologies. In 2002, Jill Stein, presumptive 2016 Green Party presidential nominee, ran for Governor of Massachusetts. She argued for same-sex marriage the whole campaign \u2014 the first gubernatorial candidate to do so in the state that first gave us marriage justice. Jason West, Green mayor of New Paltz, New York, was arrested, handcuffed, and charged, for marrying 26 same-sex couples in 2004.  Advancing recognition of sexual and gender diversity is required by our Green Party\u2019s Ten Key Values and vision for putting people, planet, and peace over profit. Currently, our platform speaks to equal rights for the entire spectrum \u2014 including queer and asexual persons. These must not be words that remain on paper, but a call to specific policies that we fight for on the campaign trail, in the ballot box, and in the streets.  We need to fight for a national non-discrimination law that protects all LGBTQIA+ and an interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that does not allow medical facilities and public businesses to opt-out of providing inclusive services to the queer community. Government documents must provide an inclusive, non-binary option, and the heightened bureaucracy to obtain documentation that aligns with how one self-identifies eliminated. Following the nation of Malta, Greens should be stronger proponents of our platform position of banning Intersex Genital Mutilation.  The arc of justice for LGTBQIA+ persons is intersectional with other realms that we as Greens care about. The right to healthcare best enacted through Single-Payer Medicare-for-All must be inclusive of psychological care, hormonal treatment, and surgical needs of gender and sexual minorities \u2014 including recognizing the higher risk of suicide attempt and addiction. Medication and other means for HIV-prevention and HIV/AIDS treatment must be affordable and accessible worldwide, which means allowing generics. Our healthcare system must recognize that individuals know best who they want at their bedside and making medical decisions with them, which may not align with blood relation and legal recognition. The LGBTQIA+ community knows well the live-giving strength of chosen family and friendship as a component of survival and resistance.  An economy policy that puts people before corporate wealth is the same economy that is more likely to leave LGBTQIA+ persons homeless or jobless. It is the same economy built on racial discrimination through its current form of an incarceration state. LGBTQIA+ persons \u2014 especially those of color \u2014 are more likely to face police violence and harassment. Many then have difficulty being placed in safe correctional facilities aligned with their gender identity and receiving necessary medical support such as hormone treatments. The right to a job, to a living wage, to food and shelter, to a community-based safety system, are Green issues with a required LGBTQIA+ perspective.  Finally, our political system prevents LGBTQIA+ persons from having a better chance at voting for and electing persons that represent their interests. The two major parties impose high barriers to get on the ballot and be included in debates. Control of the ballot box and media means queer persons fighting for survival and equality are scared to step out of line with the Democrats lest Republicans be elected. That may prevent a greater evil, but this short-sighted strategy of fear slows or even makes us regress on the path towards the greater good of justice for all LGBTQIA+ persons in the United States and around the world. Ranked-choice voting, open debates, inclusive polling, proportional representation, and popular vote, are LGBTQIA+ issues.  The Green Party may have a history of being ahead of the curve, but this fight against oppression is not over. We may be the only current national-level political party that will advocate most or even some of these policies, but for us that only raises the moral imperative to continually challenge ourselves and our party in advancing queer issues and queer voices in the streets, on the campaign trail, and in elected office.", "Healthcare is a human right.

The government now seeks to make that temporary proposal permanent, but before they can do so, they are required to solicit and accept comments from the public about the proposal.

Some of the examples CAIR gave include the rights of female travelers to request a female TSA agent for pat downs and the right to request that the hijab, or head cover worn by Muslim women, not be removed in public.  CAIR's senior litigation attorney, Gadeir Abbas, told The Associated Press the Trump administration's conduct has heightened an already tense situation among Muslims, who have come to expect a certain level of extra scrutiny while traveling.  Abbas said the Trump administration has reintroduced the practice of placing U.S. Muslim citizens on a no-fly list while they're abroad and thus exiling them until they can successfully petition the government and courts to board a flight back home. He said the practice was first introduced under the Obama administration, but had disappeared since 2014.  After Trump took office, at least one person every month has been added to the no-fly list while abroad. Among those was a mosque leader, or imam, from Salt Lake City who was in Kenya to meet his wife and children over the summer. CAIR was able to litigate on his behalf and he was removed from the no-fly list. The imam is now leading a group of pilgrims for the hajj. \"It has never been more stressful to travel as a Muslim in America,\" Abbas said.  After all the preparations, Hamed the hajj tour operator said Muslims must step out in faith.  \"We have to help them understand that God is greater, as is the obligation to fulfill your religious rite, than being scared of flying on an airplane or fearing what one may experience going through customs,\" he said.", "#CAIR-Florida Denounces Anti-Immigrant Banners Dropped in Orlando by Hate Group; Asks Police Department to Investigate  (Orlando, FL, 9/1/17) -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations - Florida (CAIR-Florida), the state's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, today denounced  another act of bigotry against the immigrant community.

The posts criticized athletes including Colin Kaepernick and Lebron James for speaking out and standing up against the oppression of black people.

We recognize their enormous role in our communities and families and their contributions to our schools, workplaces, and shared prosperity as a nation.  \u201cSince June 2012, nearly 800,000 of these young people who came to the United States as children have come forward, passed background checks, and received permission to live and work in America. With DACA, they have advanced their education, started small businesses, and more fully established themselves as integral members of our society.  \u201cEnding DACA means all of these young people would be at risk of deportation and separation from their families and our communities; this would be senselessly cruel.  \u201cEnding DACA and removing hundreds of thousands of young men and women from our workforce also would cost the country an estimated $460.3 billion in lost Gross Domestic Product over a decade and tens of billions more in lost contributions to Medicare and Social Security, and force businesses to incur $3.4 billion in turnover costs.  \u201cIn late June, attorneys general from ten states threatened to sue the Trump Administration if it does not end DACA; twice that number wrote to encourage the administration to maintain and defend the initiative. We urge President Trump to sustain his commitment and preserve DACA.  We also encourage President Trump and Republicans and Democrats in Congress to enact legislation that replaces fear and uncertainty with permanent protection for Dreamers. The recently introduced stand-alone Dream Act of 2017 would do that and we support it.  \u201cAs the leaders of communities across the country\u2014individuals and institutions that have seen these young people grow up in our communities\u2014we recognize how they have enriched and strengthened our cities, states, schools, businesses, congregations, and families. We believe it is a moral imperative that the administration and the country know we are with them.

SEE: 'Talking of Ditching Confederate Statues Could Cause Dem. to 'Go Missing' http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2017/08/29/georgia-republican-warns-democrat-she-could-go-missing-over-criticism-of-civil-war-monuments/    In a joint statement, the civil rights groups and activists also called on Rep. Spencer to apologize without reservation or to resign without delay:   \"Every Georgia lawmaker should disavow Rep. Jason Spencer's threatening remarks, and no Georgia lawmaker should accept his utterly unapologetic statement of faux regret.   \u201cIndeed, the only thing more remarkable than the threatening remarks that Rep. Spencer leveled against former Rep. LaDawn Jones is the fact that Rep. Spencer has yet to apologize for making those threats.   \u201cAlthough Rep. Spencer's Aug. 30th statement expresses regret that others 'misinterpreted' what he said, his comments were as clear as they were dangerous. Rep. Spencer sought to intimidate an African-American woman by telling her that the residents of his district would murder her, and throw her body in a swamp, if she dared to visit the region and call for the removal of its Confederate monuments.   \u201cWhat's more: Rep. Spencer portrayed Georgians who are supposedly willing to commit such violence in a favorable light, writing, 'I can guarantee you won't be met with torches but something a lot more definitive. People in South Georgia are people of action, not drama.'   \u201cEven now, Rep. Spencer sees nothing wrong with what he wrote. His Aug. 30th statement says, 'The racial division in our nation is terrible and is going to get worse if my colleague and I cannot have the kind of conversation we had on social media and will continue to have face-to-face.'   \u201cOn the contrary, the Facebook comments that Rep. Spencer made were vile, racially divisive, and quite possibly illegal. Nobody else of any profession, race, or religion would get away with making similar threats. Anyone else would be, at the least, fired, and at most, prosecuted.   \u201cRepublican and Democratic lawmakers must now unite to condemn Rep. Spencer's remarks and demand that he sincerely apologizes. House leadership must also pledge to remove Rep. Spencer from the Game, Fish & Parks committee, for a politician who raises the specter of a lynching to protect Confederate monuments from criticism has no business making decisions about those monuments.   \u201cFinally, if Rep. Spencer keeps refusing to retract and apologize for his remarks, Georgia lawmakers should demand his resignation from the Georgia General Assembly.   \u201cThis is not 1860 or even 1960. This is 2017. African-Americans must be able to exercise free speech in any part of this state, including Rep. Spencer's district, without fear of being lynched. Even the threat of racial violence has no place in the State of Georgia, much less our legislature.   \u201cAs such, Rep. Spencer must apologize without reservation or resign without delay.\"   * Co-Signing Organizations and Activists:  \u2022 American Civil Liberties Union, Georgia - Andrea Young, Executive Director \u2022 Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Stephanie Cho, Executive Director \u2022 CAIR-Georgia - Edward Ahmed Mitchell, Attorney & Executive Director \u2022 The Georgia NAACP & Atlanta NAACP - Gerald Griggs, Attorney at Law \u2022 Georgia Alliance for Social Justice - Janel Green, Co-Founder \u2022 Project South - Azadeh Shashahani, Legal Aid & Advocacy Director \u2022 Rev.

Since the violence in Charlottesville last week reminded us that white supremacy and racism are still very real in modern-day America, our nation has watched President Trump express sympathy with the goals of Neo-Nazi protesters who wanted to prevent a Confederate statue from being torn down. He\u2019s claimed he wants Confederate statues to stay up because we need to understand history, and during this live stream, we\u2019ll hear why that could not be further from the truth.  The ACLU's Jeffery Robinson will talk about why Confederate statues and monuments were erected during the Reconstruction era, how they are monuments to slavery and white supremacy, and lay out why removing them from our public spaces is a critical step towards rooting out racial injustice. We\u2019ll dive into what these symbols really mean and how they\u2019ve been used by politicians to rewrite history and incite racial violence. And at the end of the live stream, we\u2019ll invite viewers to get involved in a national effort led by Color of Change to remove Confederate statues from communities all across the country.
